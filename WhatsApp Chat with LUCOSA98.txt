3/11/22, 11:56 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Trump no use the propaganda machine wey dey the hand of liberals.
3/11/22, 11:56 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: He only expanded the foundations for wars
3/11/22, 11:56 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Trump went against NATO/Global Warming/Middle East peace/Jerusalem.
3/11/22, 11:56 AM - Osa Eweka: Wow...wish I could....sometimes I manage to do every 2 weeks...twice a week is great- Model requirements I guess
3/11/22, 11:57 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: All unpopular issues which shows that his decisions were not based on how it will look in the ratings.
3/11/22, 11:57 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: That is true leadership in my opinion.
3/11/22, 11:57 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Lmao
3/11/22, 11:57 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Your liberal politicians (and RINOs) are more concerned with 'form' over 'substance' many times.
3/11/22, 11:58 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: He wanted NATO to be more powerful
3/11/22, 11:58 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Stop to de summarise and ignore key points
3/11/22, 11:58 AM - +234 803 340 0059: This is also true
3/11/22, 11:59 AM - +234 803 340 0059: Lolz
3/11/22, 11:59 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Was he perfect? NO! Was he unhinged? YES! Wish some things would have been done differently but it was easy to see the reasons behind some of his positions.
3/11/22, 11:59 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: And most importantly he did not start a fresh war.
3/11/22, 11:59 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Awwwn
3/11/22, 12:00 PM - +234 803 340 0059: Well‚Ä¶.
3/11/22, 12:00 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Did Trump want a bigger NATO?
3/11/22, 12:00 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: @2348027443792 üëÜüèΩüëÜüèΩ
3/11/22, 12:00 PM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Let us hope Biden can tow the same path and not start another war or invade another country sha.
3/11/22, 12:01 PM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Maybe.
3/11/22, 12:01 PM - +234 803 340 0059: ?
3/11/22, 12:01 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Lmaooooo
3/11/22, 12:01 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Kai
3/11/22, 12:01 PM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: At least with EU countries contributing more.
3/11/22, 12:01 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Your bias too strong
3/11/22, 12:01 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Which would have made NATO bigger and more powerful right?
3/11/22, 12:01 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Yes or no?
3/11/22, 12:03 PM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: As of now, I don't mind NATO being bigger. NATO is an alliance against threats. If you grow bigger and are not threatening anybody no problem. If you don't invade any country under any guise, even better. It is possible to agree on both issues. That does not mean bias sir.
3/11/22, 12:03 PM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Of course yes.
3/11/22, 12:06 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Ok
3/11/22, 12:06 PM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: When I said against, I actually meant their politicians. Many of them were not happy with those comments expecting them to put in more funds take up their place instead of US footing most of the bills. I meant that Trump went against expectations on those issues.
3/11/22, 12:06 PM - Osa Eweka: <Media omitted>
3/11/22, 12:06 PM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Help us remind them o.
3/11/22, 12:07 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: So with more budget comes a stronger need to increase members and flex muscles with Russia. Possibly?
3/11/22, 12:08 PM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Not really. You can strengthen your military alliance without antagonizing Russia. You can add EU nations without spreading NATO influence to the East. When a country joins NATO you will have to set up a base there. That is where I think Putin had issues with some of the Eastern European expansion.
3/11/22, 12:13 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: You're telling me what I know
3/11/22, 12:14 PM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: They are being manipulated by the West. When its time to invade another hapless country, that is how 141 of them will still vote in favour of US.
3/11/22, 12:14 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Do u know how many countries joined NATO in the last 6 years
3/11/22, 12:17 PM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: 2 I think
3/11/22, 12:17 PM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Montenegro and Macedonia.
3/11/22, 12:19 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: <Media omitted>
3/11/22, 12:32 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Ok... thats the map of NATO and how they are working very hard to block out Russia.... so as u can see, a stronger NATO, as proposed by Trump was going to be a big time bomb waiting to explode.
3/11/22, 12:33 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Let's touch on Jerusalem.
3/11/22, 12:34 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: @2348027443792 can you tell me how Trump's stance on Jerusalem was a good one and how it has helped to bring peace to the waring parties?
3/11/22, 12:37 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: While at it, help me with info on what Trump did to help Yemen, bring  settlement with Iran, sort out Syria and quash the isolation of Qatar by the UAE and Saudi.

3/12/22, 1:54 AM - Chinedu Madu: *To be Perfect, Love your Enemies*
_(Saturday 12th March 2022. Read Deut. 26:16-19, Ps. 119:1-2,4-5,7-8, Matthew 5:43-48)_

_*‚ÄúLove your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven; for he makes his sun rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust.‚Äù (Matthew 5:44-45)*_

In today‚Äôs Gospel passage, Jesus gives us a hard pill to swallow ‚Äì love your enemies. It may be difficult, if not impossible to ‚Äúlove‚Äù to our enemies, but what Jesus demands of us is that we allow our rain and our sun to shine on our enemies. Do not practice selective kindness; be good to everyone including those who hate you. Be good to them not because they deserve it but because you are not like them. This is what it means to be perfect.

In asking us to be perfect, Jesus wants us to be like God who takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked but rejoices at their repentance. Jesus wants us to pray for our enemies, that God would touch their hearts and bring about their conversion. Jesus wants us to avoid retaliating the wrongs our enemies have done but instead, to be kind to them whenever we get the opportunity. Jesus wants us to rid our hearts of bitterness against our enemies.

Remember that in yesterday‚Äôs Gospel passage, Jesus told us that unless our righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, we would not enter the kingdom of heaven. Today, Jesus is saying that if we only love those who love us, we are not different from the rest of men. The type of righteousness Jesus demands of us is above average. It is a righteousness that seeks the wellbeing of one‚Äôs enemies rather than taking pleasure in their destruction.  

In today‚Äôs first reading, we hear the voice of Moses saying: ‚Äúyou have declared this day to walk in His ways, to keep His statutes and ordinances, to obey His voice and the Lord has declared that you are a people of His possession, that He will set you high above all nations, you shall be a people holy to the Lord.‚Äù 

What does it mean to be holy to the Lord? It is to be ‚Äúset apart‚Äù that is, to be different from the rest of the world. If the people of the world believe strongly in the principle of ‚Äúan eye for an eye‚Äù, we who are different should believe and practice the opposite. When we are slapped on one cheek, we should turn the other. This is what it takes to be holy, that is, set apart; different from the rest of the world.

Let us pray: Lord Jesus, teach me to love all my enemies as myself. Amen. 

*Be Happy. Live Positive. Have Faith. It is well with you. (Saturday of the 1st week of Lent. Bible Study: Deut. 26:16-19, Ps. 119:1-2,4-5,7-8, Matthew 5:43-48).*

3/12/22, 2:18 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: It's called calling a bluff! Ukraine had a choice of telling Russia that the US/West were not representing his nation when they speak I'm such tones.

What Russia was asking for wasn't plausible. You must put that into perspective as well.

Anyway, I'm done with this topic. I've expendedtoo much valuable time on the topic.
3/12/22, 2:47 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: You need to de read deep... not just open mouth waaaa.... Chevron is partners with PDVSA of Venezuela and they've been producing crude all along, albeit at reduced pace due to the sanctions. They can easily ramp up production to meet the 400k bpd (nothing huge compared to what they were producing per day before the sanctions). No be from shale they need to get the additional 400k bpd or some abandoned refinery.

3/12/22, 3:30 PM - Ogbole: What does Phillip Shuaibu really want?
3/12/22, 3:31 PM - Ogbole: Both him and GO came into the pdp from apc and they both became governor and deputy respectively
3/12/22, 3:32 PM - +234 809 464 9458: He wants the people that moved from Apc to be handed the same important role in pdp‚Ä¶. They were excos in Apc so he wants them to be excos in pdp
3/12/22, 3:32 PM - Ogbole: They came in with marcus onobun(Speaker EDHA)
3/12/22, 3:32 PM - Ogbole: They came in with ssg
3/12/22, 3:33 PM - Ogbole: It won't work
3/12/22, 3:33 PM - Ogbole: Because PDP had structure and excos before they came in
3/12/22, 3:34 PM - Ogbole: Why didn't they try their luck then under apga or AA
3/12/22, 3:34 PM - Ogbole: It is because pdp had an existing structure
3/12/22, 3:35 PM - Ogbole: before their entrance
3/12/22, 3:35 PM - Ogbole: So Philip Shuaibu should just go and sit down
3/12/22, 3:35 PM - +234 809 464 9458: Exactly
3/12/22, 3:36 PM - +234 809 464 9458: That‚Äôs why the party now has two factions
3/12/22, 3:36 PM - Ogbole: Talking back to a party that covered you and your boss when APC via Oshobaba humiliated you then
3/12/22, 3:37 PM - +234 809 464 9458: I swear no be small ungratefulness
3/12/22, 3:37 PM - Ogbole: If you where Dan Orbih, what will you do
3/12/22, 3:38 PM - Ogbole: This is a man that have been with the party right from time
3/12/22, 3:38 PM - Ogbole: He has made so much sacrifices for PDP in edo state
3/12/22, 3:39 PM - Ogbole: Then you that just came in yesterday want to take over the party structure cos you are the sitting governor
3/12/22, 3:40 PM - Ogbole: Well I blame PDP for this
3/12/22, 3:40 PM - +234 809 464 9458: I ll do same but they should have expected it
3/12/22, 3:40 PM - Ogbole: Gbamsolutely
3/12/22, 3:44 PM - Ogbole: Till Jesus comes, this will never work. Apart from been excos of the party, the governor can negotiate with both the old pdp members and those he came with
3/12/22, 3:45 PM - Ogbole: into the party
3/12/22, 3:45 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Problem is, there was really no time to negotiate role sharing within PDP before they decamped.
3/12/22, 3:46 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: They should have worked hard in the ast 18 months to firm up their influence within PDP
3/12/22, 3:48 PM - Ogbole: There are 18 local government areas in edo state. Let the old pdp members retain 9, negotiate for the remaining 9 to be taken over by those who came with you. Then you can compensate the 9 old pdp members who were former chairmen with commissioner position, special advisers or heads of MDAs
3/12/22, 3:48 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Na so...
3/12/22, 3:48 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: So easy
3/12/22, 3:48 PM - +234 809 464 9458: Gov no wan negotiate, he said he‚Äôs the leader of the party as a Gov
3/12/22, 3:49 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: U r a polirical genius Omion
3/12/22, 3:49 PM - +234 809 464 9458: Gov wan seize the structure so he can handover to his deputy
3/12/22, 3:49 PM - Ogbole: The Governor holds the yam, knife, pot, salt matches and water in this instance
3/12/22, 3:49 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Truth of the matter is... na GO de fuck up
3/12/22, 3:50 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Edo politicians are very cheap

3/12/22, 3:50 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Husai
3/12/22, 3:50 PM - Ogbole: He will soon loose relevance like his predecessor

3/12/22, 5:44 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: <Media omitted>
3/13/22, 3:10 AM - Chinedu Madu: *After the Cross comes the Crown*
_(Sunday 13th March 2022. Read Genesis 15:5-12,17-18, Psalm 27:1,7-9,13-14, Philippians 3:17-4:1 and Luke 9:28-36)_

_*‚ÄúLove your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven; for he makes his sun rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust.‚Äù (Matthew 5:44-45)*_

In our first reading today, Abraham demands certainty from God: ‚ÄúHow am I to know that I shall possess it?‚Äù Abraham needed something he could hold on to as an assurance that God would fulfil His Promise. A similar thing takes place in today‚Äôs Gospel passage, Jesus took Peter, James and John up the mountain and was transfigured before them to boost their faith and certainty that Christ would rise from the dead. 

As we proceed with our Lenten observances, it is easy for us to become carried away by the sorrowful side of the cross that we forget what lies beyond it. Hence, by reflecting on the Transfiguration today, God is saying to us: ‚ÄúDo not be discouraged, after the Cross comes the Crown of Glory.‚Äù 

There are many lessons we can take home today:

*One: Heaven is Worth Every Sacrifice*
When Peter exclaimed: ‚ÄúIt is wonderful to be here,‚Äù he simply summarized what heaven will be like. When we reach that state of the beatific vision, when we get to behold God face to face, we get to receive our crowns and join the choirs of angels singing Halleluiahs, we too shall say: It is wonderful to be here. Peter immediately thought about building tents, because he did not want to leave. I bet you, no one who has had a glimpse of heaven would love to return here.

*Two: Jesus is the Fulfilment of the Law and Prophets*
The two characters present at the Transfiguration, Moses and Elijah offer us deeper insight into the Messianic Role of Jesus. While Moses represents the Law, Elijah represents all the prophets. Everything contained in the entire Old Testament finds its ultimate fulfilment in Jesus. Jesus is truly the Son of God, the promised Messiah, the Saviour of the World, the one whom God sent to deliver mankind from death and destruction.

Luke further adds that Moses and Elijah spoke to Jesus about His exodus which He was to fulfil in Jerusalem. This means that just as Abraham needed some assurance, Jesus needed assurance. When we face trials and tribulations, God never leaves us in the dark.

*Three: Every Prayer is a Transfiguration*
It is important to note that the transfiguration occurred within the context of prayer. As Luke puts it, ‚ÄúJesus took with him Peter and John and James and went up on the mountain to pray. And as he was praying, the appearance of his countenance changed‚Ä¶‚Äù Prayer is powerful. Prayer brings heaven to earth and takes us up to heaven. A lot of things happen when we pray some of which we cannot even withstand with our ordinary eyes. 

Are you finding it difficult to pray? Take some time to meditate on the Transfiguration and tell yourself and each time to go on your knees to pray, God and all his Angels gather around you. Think of your favourite Saint being present right there with you.

*Four: God Speaks to us when we Pray*
Still, in the context of Jesus‚Äô prayer, we hear a voice from the cloud ‚ÄúThis is my Son, my Chosen; Listen to Him!‚Äù A similar thing happened in the Baptism of Jesus. As Jesus rose from the water and was praying, the Holy Spirit descended upon him in bodily form, as a dove, and a voice came from heaven, ‚ÄúThou art my beloved Son; with whom I am well pleased.‚Äù (Luke 3:21-22). Prayer is a dialogue, it is only complete when we can listen and hear from God after we have spoken to Him. 

Prayer teaches us obedience. God says: ‚ÄúThis is my Son, my Chosen, listen to Him.‚Äù The more prayerful we become, the more we are most likely enabled to obey the commandments of God. The more we pray, we more we long to listen to Jesus by reading the Bible. The more we pray, the more we grow deeper in our walk with God.

*Five: To be Earthly Minded is to be God‚Äôs Enemy*
In our second reading today, St. Paul warns us about people who ‚Äúwalk as enemies of the cross of Christ, their end is destruction, their god is the belly, their glory in their shame, their minds set on earthly things.‚Äù Indeed, among the Christian community, some people were already preaching the Gospel of prosperity and living as if this world is all there is.

The greatest scandal Christianity faces today come from men and women of God whose lavish lifestyles betray the Cross of Christ. There even seems to be a competition among these ministers with regards to worldly riches meanwhile 90 per cent of their flock are living in totally impoverished conditions. Many are now of the suggestion that churches, especially in Africa, should be closed down since they have failed to add moral value to the society but have rather become business centres for their founders and general overseers.

*Conclusion: Our Hope is in Heaven not here on Earth*
In the words of St. Paul ‚ÄúFor I consider the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing to the glory that is to be revealed in us‚Äù (Rom 8:18). ‚ÄúEye has not seen nor ear heard, neither has it entered into the heart of men those things that God has prepared for those who love him‚Äù (I Cor. 2:9).

The fact that things are not working out for you right now should not make you look back. The fact that people are laughing at you now should not make you drop the cross. After the Cross, comes the Glory. 

Let us pray: Lord Jesus, open my eyes as I pray daily to see the glory that awaits me in heaven. Amen.

*Be Happy. Live Positive. Have Faith. It is well with you. (2nd Sunday of Lent. Bible Study: Gen. 15:5-12,17-18, Ps. 27:1,7-9,13-14, Phil. 3:17-4:1, Luke 9:28-36).*

3/14/22, 3:48 AM - Chinedu Madu: *The Measure You Give is the Measure You Get Back*
_(Monday 14th March 2022. Read Daniel 9:4-10, Ps. 79:8-9,11,13, Luke 6:36-38)_

_*‚ÄúGive, and it will be given to you; good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, will be put into your lap. For the measure you give will be the measure you get back.‚Äù (Luke 6:38)*_

I am sure you are quite familiar with this verse of the Bible; ‚Äúgive and it shall be given unto you.‚Äù You hear it at fundraising events, you hear it sang by the choir when your donations are requested. It may interest you to note that Jesus was not even talking about money when he said these words. 

Jesus was talking out being merciful to others, forgiving people, refraining from passing judgement and condemnation on others. Jesus was talking about loving our enemies. By giving so that it will be given unto us, Jesus was re-echoing the words of the prayer which he taught us: ‚ÄúForgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us.‚Äù For if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. 

Our first reading today contains the prayer of Daniel for and on behalf of the nation of Israel. The bottom line of this prayer is a plea for God‚Äôs mercy over the sins of the people. ‚ÄúTo the Lord belongs mercy and forgiveness because we have rebelled against him and have not obeyed the voice of the Lord our God.‚Äù 

If God forgives us of our faults, we too should forgive others. Jesus taught us to ‚Äúbe perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect.‚Äù The essence of this perfection is loving our enemies. Today, Jesus is saying: ‚Äúbe merciful even as your Father is merciful.‚Äù If we say God is our Father, we must resemble Him by treating people with mercy, kindness, and compassion. 

The opposite of mercy is condemnation. To condemn is to write off a person as good for nothing, irredeemable, beyond repair, and disposable. If God never gives up on us, why should we give up on our fellow human beings? As our responsorial psalm sings: ‚ÄúO Lord, do not treat us according to our sins.‚Äù If this is our prayer, then we too should not treat people according to their sins.

Let us pray: Lord Jesus, give me a merciful heart like yours. Amen.

*Be Happy. Live Positive. Have Faith. It is well with you. (Monday of the 2nd week of Lent. Bible Study: Daniel 9:4-10, Ps. 79:8-9,11,13, Luke 6:36-38).*

3/14/22, 5:03 AM - Osa Eweka: *Chronology to understand the crisis in Ukraine* (Between History and Geography)

 *1945:*
 - End of the war.
 - Germany is defeated by the 4 allies (USA, USSR, France and Great Britain).

 *1949:*

 - Following misunderstandings between the 4 allies, they are divided into two blocks: 3 (USA + FR + GB) against 1 (USSR).

 - The USA + FR + GB created the FRG and the USSR created the RDA.

 - Under the leadership of the USA, the 3 Westerners created a military alliance (NATO) which brings together a dozen Western countries.  To date, they are about thirty in total

 - In response to NATO, the USSR created the *Warsaw Pact* in 1955 with the communist countries of Eastern Europe,

 *1989:*

 - The Berlin Wall falls.

 - The USSR is further weakened especially since it has lost a lot of men and its economy is weakened.  The crisis settles between the countries of the Soviet Union

 - Many want to emancipate themselves, especially since they now see the rest of the world after the fall of the Berlin Wall.  These countries are also influenced by Westerners who have more resources than the bankrupt USSR.


 *1991:*

 - The USSR is broken up and begins to lose its member states (15)

 - After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, a number of former Warsaw Pact countries changed sides and became members of NATO.

 - Russia is created and keeps a strategic influence in some countries of the former Soviet Union.

 - Russia is aware of the NATO threat.  She will therefore "negotiate" an agreement with the Western leaders who give *oral* assurances to Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin on the non-expansion of NATO towards the East.

 *NB: Gorbachev is making a big mistake by not requiring a written agreement*


 - The principle is therefore: "*Not an inch to the East*" (Any expansion of the NATO area is not acceptable)

 *Since 1999*

 - Taking advantage of Russia's weakness, NATO continues to expand towards the East and is getting closer and closer to Russia.

 - From now on the only "real" countries of the Ex.  USSR which remain as a border between Russia and the Westerners therefore of NATO, it is Ukraine and Georgia.

 - Boris Yeltsin's presidency was marked by financial and political crises, as well as corruption cases.  Weakened by illness, he resigned on December 31, 1999

 - Vladimir Putin came to power in 99. He is 47 years old.  Younger, he tries to correct the mistakes of his predecessors and begins to straighten the economy of Russia.  He tries a rapprochement with NATO which does not really work but he remains patient.

 *2004*

 - A lot of countries from the former Soviet bloc are admitted into NATO: Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Romania, Slovakia, Bulgaria.

 - Two other principals also want to join: Georgia and Ukraine which border Russia and above all have access to the Black Sea.

 - These 2 countries are very strategic for Russia.  If they join NATO, the US will therefore be face to face with Russia.  So, we must prevent them by all means.

 *2004*

 - Ukraine is "divided" politically into pro-Russia and pro-EU.  Some want to stay under Russian influence and others under Western influence

 - Part of the Ukrainian people are revolting to contest the re-election of pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych and demand a rapprochement with the European Union.

 - The civil revolution wins the pro-Russian president.  And a pro-European Union regime took power between 2005 and 2010, bringing Ukraine closer to the European Union.

 *2010:*

 - A pro-Russian Viktor Yanukovych regains power in Ukraine but a pro-EU "revolution" (Euromaidan) pushes him to resign and he flees to Russia in 2014.

 - Russia no longer having its men at the head of Georgia and Ukraine, it will "abandon" its project of necessarily having a colt at the head of Ukraine.  It will "cause" secessions with separatists in the localities of Ukraine close to its borders, particularly in the Donbass which includes two localities in the east of the country: Donetsk and Luhansk.

 *2014*

 - The pro-EU are back in power.

 - To avoid completely losing control over its borders, Russia "encourages" demonstrations against the Orange Revolution ("Antimaidan") in eastern Ukraine to accelerate the secession of Donetsk and Luhansk (Ukrainian cities in  the Russian border)

 - At the same time, Russia managed to annex Crimea a territory of Ukraine in 2018.

 - With these three localities (Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk) which are the closest to Russia, it is more or less reassured to have a strip of territory which separates it from Ukraine and therefore from NATO if Ukraine  had just been admitted to NATO

 - Following local referendums, two independent entities called ‚ÄúDonetsk People's Republic‚Äù and ‚ÄúLuhansk People's Republic‚Äù are self-proclaimed.

 - Ukraine supported by the West tries to recover its territories and carries out reprisals.

 - Russians accuse Ukraine of genocide in Donetsk and Luhansk territories

 - In July 2014, the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777, operating flight MH17, was shot down over the region by a missile, killing the 298 passengers, two thirds of whom were Dutch.  Europeans are worried and the crisis is becoming international.  The USA is more active.

 *2014-2015*

 - Signature of the Minsk protocol for a ceasefire

 - From 2014 to 2015, the conflict killed more than 14,000 people, injured tens of thousands and displaced nearly two million people.  Russia accuses Ukraine of genocide.

 *2019*

 - April 21, 2019, it's the election of Volodymyr Zelensky (a comedian artist) to the Ukrainian presidency
 He is also a European pro

 - He tries to recover Donetsk and Luhansk.  The separatists are resisting and several deaths are recorded

 *2020*

 - The peace agreement is broken.  Ukraine accuses Donetsk and Luhansk.
 The Russian troops fear an attack and mobilize on the border of the 2 new States to protect them and protect the Russian territory.

 *2022*

 - NATO announces placing troops on alert to strengthen its defenses in Eastern Europe

 - Faced with Russian demands for the withdrawal of NATO forces from Eastern Europe and the assurance that Ukraine will never join the Atlantic Alliance, the latter as well as the United States explicitly refuse these demands on January 26, 2022  .

 - The NATO Secretary General recalls that membership issues were the sole responsibility of the Allies and candidate countries.  So Russia don't have to interfere

 - Putin recalls unwritten agreements with Gorbachev in 91 not to hear NATO bases to the East.

 - France and Germany try to ease tensions and hope for de-escalation ensues

 - Russia is still not reassured by the game of Westerners.  This time, she feels ready to face the Westerners.

 - Russia will therefore officially recognize the independence of the Republics of Donetsk and Luhansk.

 - These two territories being now "independent", Russia can then officially enter the separatist territories

 - On February 20, 2022, Vladimir Putin signs the act of recognition of the two separatist territories of Donbass in Ukraine: the People's Republic of Donetsk and the People's Republic of Luhansk.

 - At the same time, the 2 new Republics request assistance from Russia to protect them against attacks from Ukraine.

 - Russia evokes Chapter 7 of the UN protection against attacks, particularly of civilians and decides to help the "2 States in danger" but it does not inform the Security Council.

 - The Russian parliament gives mandate to assist and protect the "allied states" of Russia which would be threatened with "genocide by Ukraine.

 Thus, the objective according to the Russian authorities is not to attack a sovereign State (Ukraine) but to destroy the weapons and military bases which would threaten 2 independent States.

 - For Russia, after having destroyed the weapons of Ukraine and having realized that the 2 States are no longer threatened, it will be able to withdraw.  According to the words of Putin and Sergei Lavrov (Minister of Foreign Affairs).

 - Russia also suspects Ukraine of wanting to acquire nuclear weapons which would be a threat to its territory and its allies Donetsk and Luhansk.


 According to the agreements signed between Russia, Donetsk and Luhansk and published on the Duma website, these agreements, valid for a decade, provide in particular that the parties will ensure their defense, share military bases and protect their borders in common.

 The agreements create the legal basis for the presence in these territories of the Russian military units necessary to maintain peace in the region and to ensure lasting security for the parties, according to an explanatory note accompanying these texts.

 They set out the parties' obligations to provide mutual assistance if one of the parties is the target of an attack, and provide for the joint protection of borders.

3/14/22, 10:36 AM - Osa Eweka: Obaseki to Wike: PDP is not your personal property, Edo cannot be procured

The recent personal attacks by His Excellency, the Governor of Rivers State, Rt. Hon. Nyesom Wike, against my Deputy Governor, Rt. Hon. Comrade Philip Shaibu is, to say the least, most unfortunate and totally uncalled for.  

If Governor Wike was one who is wont to show respect and courtesy to his colleague-governors, he would have ordinarily reached out to me to express his concerns about the views made by my deputy governor, rather than embarking on this unwarranted public onslaught.  

My deputy governor was a former National President of the National Association of Nigerian Student (NANS) and his comment is representative of the essence of the nation‚Äôs youth population, who are inclined to openly speak up and question the status quo. If Governor Wike cannot understand and adequately respond to the style and character of the Nigerian youth, how can he aspire to lead them?

His Excellency, Governor Wike should have taken a cue from the manner in which the National Chairman of our party, Sen. Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, responded to my deputy‚Äôs remarks, as a conscientious leader who is able to show empathy and consideration.

The concerns expressed by my deputy governor bordered on pertinent issues affecting the PDP in Edo State which since the September 19th 2020 elections, has been able to register over 500,000 members; and till date, these new members have not been properly integrated into our party after two years.

Also, the leaders, executives and members who came with me into the party have still not been accepted, integrated or harmonized into the party.

More worrisome is the fact that old members of Edo PDP, who are open to inclusion and supportive of building a large party are being vilified and ostracized by a cabal purportedly led by Chief Dan Orbih, who is your perpetual guest in Port Harcourt and is remotely used to orchestrate the destabilization of the party in Edo State. 

It is necessary to recall at this point that a political solution gave rise to the emergence of Chief Dan Orbih first as Acting and then as Substantive National Vice Chairman, South South, of our party, when Chief Emma Ogidi resigned that position to allow Chief Orbih to ascend.

It is therefore curious why this type of political solution is no longer tenable to resolve the political impasse in Edo State PDP. 

We can categorically state that in the comments of the deputy governor, he at no point threatened the party as Governor Wike has alleged. Rather, it is Governor Wike, who has at different times, threatened the PDP. Some of these instances include: 

1. On September 16, 2018, Governor Wike threatened the party that there would be grave consequences if it moved the National Convention from Port Harcourt in the run up to the 2019 presidential election.

2. On September 12, 2019, Governor Wike also threatened to cause trouble for the party over the emergence of Hon. Ndudi Elumelu as the Minority Leader of the House of Representatives.

Undoubtedly, Governor Wike has contributed to the advancement of the party, just like others, since 1999.

No one is against his desire to run for president, however, his ambition should not be embarked on in such a way that it would cause disruption at different levels, such as the PDP Governors‚Äô Forum as well as different chapters of the party across the country.

It clearly amounts to delusion of grandeur, for any one man to nurse the idea that he owns or has more stake in the PDP and everyone should pander to him.

We are all equal stakeholders in the party and an aggregate of the ideas, opinions and contributions of all leaders and members should form the position of the party and not the view of one individual or a select few.

While Governor Wike is free to use his resources as he deems fit in pursuit of his ambition, he should not attempt to cow, intimidate, cajole and threaten others into doing his bidding. Edo State cannot and will not be procured for anyone‚Äôs personal ambition.

What Nigeria needs now are strong democratic institutions and not strong men; that is why we will join the great leaders of our party across the country to build PDP into a strong, large and indomitable party that will win next year‚Äôs presidential election. 

Governor Wike and his collaborators headed by Chief Dan Orbih in Edo State will not succeed in destabilizing the PDP in Edo State as they did other states like Cross River just to secure delegates to actualize his alleged personal ambition to run for presidency in 2023.

In Edo, we don‚Äôt accept political bullies and overlords and historically, we have demonstrated our capacity to unshackle ourselves and dethrone bullies and highhanded leaders.

I appeal to all well-meaning leaders of our great party to call Governor Wike to order, to desist from his current unguarded and disruptive tendencies. From all indications today, PDP is set to take over the leadership of Nigeria provided we can rein in the self interest of a few leaders to put the task of rescuing Nigeria above their personal ambitions.

He says I am interfering in Edo State,  he should come and interfere in Rivers too. Then he will know who is who.
How can somebody that just came to PDP in 2020, me that has been in the party since 1999.
He is one of the people that brought in this government of evil.
You're not condemning the Government of evil (APC), we will not condone evil.
To say you don't want PDP, I have more stake in PDP, because anything can happen and you run.You cannot dissolve an existing structure you met. But me, I am not running, I did not come to PDP with any structure, I fought a sitting Governor and took the party structure.
A Governor as leader of the party should reach out to his State, LGA and Ward Exco and not running to Abuja to seek for harmonisation. Obaseki should come and learn politics
If you challenge me, I will challenge you back, if you push me, I will push you.
He has touched where he is supposed not to touch and he will get what he is supposed to get.
Some of them cannot even talk before me but I will make them talk."

3/14/22, 11:44 AM - Ogbole: Gov. Nyesom Wike replies Obaseki at the commissioning of community secondary school, Omuanwa, in Ikwerre LGA.

"Obaseki said I'm a bully, but he came to beg a bully for ticket, a bully was his campaign DG, and a bully bullied him into Edo state government house"

"It didn't end there, he still came back with his wife to thank the bully after the election"

"I slept in Edo State for three days just to deliver Obaseki, but today, I'm a bully"

"If you check the DNA of Obaseki, what you'll see is betrayal, serial betrayal and ungratefulness"

"He said I threatened PDP, assuming without conceding that I threatened PDP, I have every right to do so, I have invested in the party. Rivers State has invested in the party"

"Rivers State is one of the few states that has voted PDP since 1999, we have invested in the party"

"You're a tenant in PDP, I have more stake in PDP than you"

"You said I'm causing crisis in Edo state, I have capacity, that is why I'm causing crisis. 
I challenge you to come and cause crisis in Rivers state, then you'll know who is who"

"Obaseki, I know your cohorts, I will smoke all of you out"

Obaseki, I challenge you to defect back to the APC, we'll shave your head"

 ‚ÄúI know those using you, if I decide to run for President, I will win all of you‚Äù

"Obaseki, melembe melembe"

"The game has started, I will make you loose weight‚Äù

3/14/22, 12:32 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: It's a 650k bpd refinery. Not sure what the nigerian petrol consumption is
3/14/22, 12:32 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: And don't think it is meant to cater for all of Nigerias fuel needs
3/14/22, 12:34 PM - +234 803 340 0059: My tots exactly. Cos I come Dey hear say all these fuel wahala na to pave way for dangote

3/14/22, 12:36 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Bubu signed 3trillion for subsidy
3/14/22, 12:39 PM - +234 803 340 0059: Yes o! I remember this
3/14/22, 12:43 PM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: I know it is weird to make this comparison but Young people leaving their countries to fight Russia on behalf of Ukraine sounds like Young Muslims signing up to fight in Syria or Iraq on the side of ISIS or AL-QAEDA (groups which claimed to be liberating the citizens of those countries while trying to install their own caliphate). It just shows how brainwashing produces pretty much the same results.
3/14/22, 12:46 PM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Subsidy fraud is childs play compared to the current looting of crude oil.
3/14/22, 1:05 PM - Nehi Igbinijesu: Wow! 4000 messages
3/14/22, 1:05 PM - Nehi Igbinijesu: I am a bonafide tunnelite
3/14/22, 1:06 PM - Nehi Igbinijesu: Greetings to all men
3/14/22, 1:09 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Just different cartels
3/14/22, 1:13 PM - Nehi Igbinijesu: Quick question. Nigeria has oil. Nigeria is not selling as much and there is a world class refinery in Nigeria that can end importation and meet local demand. Bubu can also force that refinery to sell its product locally by adjusting its license. Is there any reason else why there is fuel scarcity. Because from banking sources, the scarcity is caused by the exchange rate and jump in crude prices.
3/14/22, 1:16 PM - +234 803 340 0059: Na these words I Dey try find since! Different cartels, different pay!
3/14/22, 1:18 PM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Stolen crude money >>>>>>>> Subsidy money
3/14/22, 1:19 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: No argument here
3/14/22, 1:19 PM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Also most subsidy fuel is imported through crude oil swaps. The stolen crude is so much there isn't even enough to swap right now.
3/14/22, 1:20 PM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: As in right now the level of stealing of Nigeria's crude is mind boggling.
3/14/22, 1:22 PM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Dangote has not started refining yet. And the problem is just corruption. The people stealing are not wasting their time thinking about whether to try and make the product available and cheap. They just want quick money.
3/14/22, 1:22 PM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: The looting going on right now in Nigeria is the kind you see when people are looting burning shops/markets or stealing from a sinking ship. It requires psychological research/study.
3/14/22, 1:26 PM - Nehi Igbinijesu: Wow! Anyway, all the stories coming out of Nigeria right now are just devilish. 17 yo doing yahoo yahoo rituals, political actors robbing the country blind and zero governance. Like it is only an authentic move of God that can deliver Nigeria right now
3/14/22, 1:27 PM - Nehi Igbinijesu: We that pray will continue. Our God will perform once Nigeria‚Äôs cup is full. Na mercy eye God take dey look Naija right now
3/14/22, 1:29 PM - +234 803 340 0059: üôèüèø
3/14/22, 1:38 PM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: We are praying brother. The level of despair is so much. Nigerians are strong people. We pray that a great leader comes in 2023 to start the process of turning things around.

3/14/22, 4:56 PM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Countries sending arms to Ukraine (at no cost) -

The US & NATO members have sent at least 17,000 anti-tank missiles and anti-aircraft missiles.

Germany sends 1000 anti-tank missiles, stringer air defence missiles.

Canada sends 4500 M72 Rocket launchers and 7500 hand grenades.

Belgium sends 2000 machine guns, 3000 automatic weapons, 200 anti-tank weapons, 3800 tonnes of fuel.

Netherlands sends sniper rifles, land mine detectors, etc.

Czech Republic sends 30,000 pistols, 7000 assault rifles, 3000 machine guns.

Denmark sends 2700 shoulder-launched anti-tank missiles.

Norway sends 2000 M72 anti-tank weapons, bullet-proof vests.

Italy sends stinger surface to air missiles, mortars, counter-IED systems.

Finland sends 2000 bulletproof vests, 2000 helmets and stretchers.

Estonia sends 2400 Soviet-era semiautomatic pistols.

Greece send Kalashnikov-type assault rifles

Other countries supplying arms include Poland, Greece, Slovenia, Slovakia, etc‚Ä¶

Poland actually donated its MIG jet fighters for use if need be!

Hmmm‚Ä¶
In less than two weeks, the response in supplying arms by western nations to Ukraine at no cost makes me wonder how come Nigeria is begging these same people for permission to even PURCHASE same weapons for years to combat Boko-Haram??

The black man should use his sense and know that his life and well-being are never the priority to these western nations.

3/14/22, 11:36 PM - Chinedu Madu: *You Are What You Do*
_(Tuesday 15th March 2022. Read Isaiah 1:10,16-20, Ps. 50:8-9,16-17,21,23, Matthew 23:1-12)_

_*‚ÄúPractice and observe whatever they tell you, but not what they do; for they preach, but do not practice.‚Äù (Matthew 23:3)*_

You are not what you say you are. You are not what you think you are. You are not what others think you are. You are not what your job description says. You are what you do! It was the type of life people were living that merited them the name ‚ÄúChristian.‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt because they were called Christians that made them live like that. If you really want to know who you are, forget about your titles or what anyone is saying and find out what your actions (especially those you do in secret) are saying about you.

Being called a priest, a doctor, a lawyer or whatever does not make you one. Your actions are the true test of your identity. The scribes and Pharisees prided themselves as the religious leaders of the day but Jesus called them the name their actions depicted: hypocrites. They preached the truth but practiced falsehood. 

Jesus told the people to obey their preaching but ignore their actions. Jesus even went as far as challenging the titles they gave themselves since their actions were a contradiction. Don‚Äôt call them rabbi. Don‚Äôt call them master. Don‚Äôt call them Father. They don‚Äôt deserve those. Call them by their names.
 
Is there a contradiction between what I preach and what I do? Am living in pretence? Then as the prophet Isaiah says today: ‚ÄúWash yourselves; make yourselves clean; remove the evil of your doing from before my eyes, learn to do good, seek justice, correct oppression, defend the fatherless, plead for the widow‚Ä¶‚Äù (Isaiah 1:16ff). Do not simply answer a name. Become the name. 

Let us pray: Lord Jesus, show me the path of true holiness. Amen.

*Be Happy. Live Positive. Have Faith. It is well with you. (Tuesday of the 2nd week of Lent. Bible Study: Isaiah 1:10,16-20, Ps. 50:8-9,16-17,21,23, Matthew 23:1-12).*

3/15/22, 11:11 PM - Chinedu Madu: *Do You Want to Be Great? Then be a Servant!*
_(Wednesday 16th March 2022. Read: Jer. 18:18-20, Ps. 31:5-6,14-16, Matthew 20:17-28)_ 

¬© Rev. Fr. Evaristus Abu

_*‚ÄúWhoever would be great among you must be your servant, and whoever would be first among you must be your slave; even as the Son of man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.‚Äù (Matthew 20:26-28)*_

On their way to Jerusalem, towards the end of Jesus‚Äô earthly ministry, Jesus wanted to prepare the minds of his disciples for what was going to happen in the coming days. He didn‚Äôt want them to be scandalized when they would see their master arrested like a common criminal, beaten, insulted, dehumanized, and made to carry a heavy cross. 

This was not the first time Jesus was predicting His arrest and crucifixion. On one occasion, Peter tried to object to this but Jesus said to him: ‚ÄúGet behind me, Satan.‚Äù None of the disciples dared to challenge Jesus again. On this occasion, the mother of James and John, (wife of Zebedee), came up to Jesus with her sons asking: ‚ÄúCommand that these two sons of mine may sit, one at your right and one at your left in your kingdom.‚Äù 

For those who believe that James and John were biological brothers of Jesus, this passage definitely proves them wrong. One, James and John were described as ‚Äúsons of Zebedee‚Äù not ‚Äúsons of Joseph.‚Äù Two, the name of the woman who brought them was not mentioned but if it was the mother of Jesus, the gospel writer would have indicated it. Three, this woman had only two sons hence she asked Jesus to ‚Äúcommand that these two sons of mine may sit, one at your right and one at your left‚Ä¶‚Äù Four, if they were biological brothers, they would never have bothered to make such a request in public.

James and John together with Peter were closest to Jesus among the twelve disciples. It was the three of them that Jesus took with Him to the Mount of Transfiguration. It was the three of them that Jesus took with Him into the home of the little girl who was reported to have died. James and John considered themselves the most qualified for those seats so they decided to bring their mother to Jesus to ask. (After all, Jesus said: ‚ÄúAsk and you will receive‚Ä¶‚Äù Matthew 7:7) 

Jesus could see how serious they were about getting the seats in heaven. Jesus asked if they would be willing to drink ‚Äúthe cup that I am to drink‚Äù. Without asking the meaning of this cup, they responded: ‚ÄúWe are able!‚Äù Jesus said: ‚ÄúOk, you will drink my cup but that would not guarantee you the seats‚Äù (This teaches us that none of us can boast with regards to heavenly rewards). Jesus, knowing that what they were asking for was not bad decided to teach not just James and John, but all who were listening, the secret of greatness. Suffering (drinking the cup) may not guarantee heaven but being a servant of others will surely get you to heaven. Jesus said: ‚ÄúWhoever would be great among you must be your servant and whoever would be first among you must be your slave.‚Äù

The secret to greatness is the service of others. Just as respect begets respect, service begets promotion. The quickest way to become great is to humble yourself in the service of others; in other words, the quickest way to rise is to help others to rise. If you ever find yourself in a position of service, consider it a privilege; see it as a period of training for greatness. I am convinced that during those years that Joseph was a slave, God was preparing him for the office of the Prime Minister. Denzel Washington once said: ‚ÄúEase is a greater threat to progress than adversity.‚Äù 

By his very life, Jesus showed us that the key to greatness is service. St. Paul says: Jesus ‚Äúemptied himself, taking the form of a servant‚Ä¶. Therefore, God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth.‚Äù (Philippians 2:5-11). Serve others with gladness. God will lift you to greater heights.

Let us pray: Lord Jesus, teach me to find joy in being a servant. Amen.

*Be Happy. Live Positive. Have Faith. It is well with you. (Wednesday of the 2nd week of Lent. Bible Study: Jer. 18:18-20, Ps. 31:5-6,14-16, Matthew 20:17-28).*

3/17/22, 3:39 AM - Chinedu Madu: *Exploring your Spiritual Potentials.*
_(Thursday 17th March 2022. Read: 1 Peter 4:7-11, Ps. 96:1-3,7-8,10, Luke 5:1-11)_ 

¬© Rev. Fr. Evaristus Abu

_*‚ÄúAnd Jesus said to Simon, ‚ÄòDo not be afraid; henceforth you will be catching men.‚Äô And when they had brought their boats to land, they left everything and followed him.‚Äù (Luke 5:10-11)*_

Every human being is a bundle of potentials. Made in the image and likeness of God, there is virtually no limit to the range of human positive possibilities. One of my favourite quotations goes thus: ‚ÄúIt is our light, not our darkness that frightens us the most.‚Äù When we consider what we are capable of doing if we let our light shine, we become scared of ourselves. 

There is so much good inside of us waiting to be explored, waiting to be shared, waiting to be discovered and used by the millions of people out there. There is so much you can do for God. We exist to be good. We are alive to touch people positively. It all begins with allowing our inner light to shine. 

This is what St. Peter encourages us to do in the first reading of today. ‚ÄúPractice hospitality ungrudgingly to one another. As each has received a gift, employ it for one another, as good stewards of God‚Äôs varied grace.‚Äù If you have the talent of speaking, let your words be uplifting, if serving is your talent, serve as though you are an Angel from heaven, if it is writing, then write what is true and beneficial to your readers. Whatever is your gift, use it to build up the community. 

Peter was shocked when his net caught such a huge catch of fish in broad daylight. He had worked all night long without any success but only reluctantly threw his net into the sea at the command of Jesus. Peter represents a lot of people in our world who have no idea of their potential until they meet Jesus. And just as Peter obeyed the word of Jesus to cast his net into the sea, we would all be surprised what we are capable of doing, if only we decide to obey God‚Äôs words every day of our life.

We remember St. Patrick today, a man who like Peter fully explored his spiritual potential making such a huge catch of souls in Ireland. The faith was firmly established there. Virtually every family had a priest or sister. We are eternally grateful to the Irish missionaries who evangelized our country Nigeria. Through one man St. Patrick, millions have been touched. Do you know what you are capable of doing if you just let your light shine?

Let us pray: Lord Jesus, use me till nothing else is left of me. Amen.

*Be Happy. Live Positive. Have Faith. It is well with you. (St Patrick, Bishop: Secondary Patron of Nigeria ‚Äì Feast. Bible Study: 1 Peter 4:7-11, Ps. 96:1-3,7-8,10, Luke 5:1-11).*

¬© Rev. Fr. Evaristus Abu
3/17/22, 3:47 AM - +234 803 340 0059: Instead of the meat fast in Lent, Pope Francis offers 15 simple acts of charity. 

Look how beautiful it is! 

1. **Greet. (* always and everywhere)

2. Say Thanks *(even if you don't want to, *you should‚Äù do it)* 

3. Remind others how much you *love them*

4. *Greet happily*  those people you see every day. 

5. Listening to each other's *story*, without prejudice, *with love*. 

6 Stopping to *help*. *Be attentive to those who need you* 

7 *Raise the
moral* of someone. 

8 *Celebrate* the *qualities* or *success* of another. 

9 ‚Å∏ *Select* what you don't use and *give* to those who need it. 

10 **Help when needed* to get someone else to rest. 

11 *Correct with love,* don't shut up out of fear. 

12 *Having good discussion* with those who are *close to you

13 *Clean what you use at home*

14 *Help others overcome obstacles*. 

15 *Call your parents*, if you are lucky enough to have them. 

‚Ä¢ *Fast from hurtful words* : conveying kind words

‚Ä¢ *Fast from discontentment*: fill yourself with gratitude

‚Ä¢ *Fast from anger* : fill yourselves with forbearance and patience

‚Ä¢ *Fast from pessimism* : fill yourself with hope and optimism

‚Ä¢ *Fast from worries* : fill yourself with trust in God

‚Ä¢ *Fast from complaining* : fill yourself with the simple things in life

‚Ä¢ *Fasting from pressures*: fill yourself with prayer

‚Ä¢ **Fast from sorrows  and bitterness* : fill your heart with joy

‚Ä¢ *Fast from selfishness*: filling yourself with compassion for others

‚Ä¢ *Fast from unforgiveness*: fill yourself with reconciling attitudes

‚Ä¢ *Word fast*: fill yourself with silence and listening to others

If we all attempt this fast, our daily life will be filled with:

*PEACE*

*TRUST*

*CONFIDENCE*

*FAITH*

*RELIANCE*

*BELIEF*

*CERTITUDE*

*JOY*

*DELIGHT*

*GLADNESS*

*GLEE*

*MERRIMENT*

*ECSTASY*

*SUNSHINE*

*FESTIVITIES*

AND *LIFE*

Great wisdom from Pope Francis in this Lenten proposal, which is why I gladly share it!!!

Why Bianca Slapped Osodieme.

AIF Media.

A fight broke out at the venue of the swearing in ceremony of Prof Charles Chukwuma Soludo this morning when Iyom Bianca Odimegwu Ojukwu slapped the out gone First Lady of Anambra, Mrs Ebelechukwu Obiano.

AIF Media reporter at the venue said, the fight started when Mrs Obiano who came late to the occasion was going round to greet the dignitaries. On getting to where Bianca sat, she said. "Bianca so you are here, what are you doing here, I thought you said you will never attend any APGA event again, you bitch."

Ojukwu's wife who was provoked by that silly remark stood up quickly and gave her a dirty slap and dragged her wig off her head.

This caused disruption to the oath of office being taken by Prof Charles Soludo who was signing some documents as at the time of the slap.

More details coming...

3/17/22, 4:23 PM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: *Funny Legal Case.* ‚öñÔ∏è‚öñÔ∏è‚öñÔ∏è‚öñÔ∏è‚öñÔ∏è

 *Dis Is One Of The Reasons One Shuld  Follow Court Proceedings.*

*Who Is A Bastard?*

*Moral of the story - Be careful how you seek judgement, for it might just confirm a judgement not to your liking.*

*Defamation Gone Awry!*
*Segun Babatola Vs Chief Remi Oguntuase* 

In year 2000, Governor Adeniyi Adebayo of Ekiti State set up a Petroleum Task Force to monitor the distribution and sale of petroleum products to ensure the availability of petrol at the controlled price. He appointed Chief Remi Oguntuase as the chairman of the Task Force.

The problem of scarcity of petrol was a matter of interest as well as concern to the public, hence the Broadcasting Service of Ekiti State, in one of its programmes, had a phone interview with Chief Remi Oguntuase on the problems facing the task force on the scarcity of petrol and the steps he was taking to combat the problems. 

After answering questions from the moderator of the programme, the session was thrown open to the public for interested members  of the public to ask questions from Chief Oguntuase. 
The procedure was for the person who wanted to ask any question to first introduce himself and then proceed to ask his questions or make his contribution. 

A seemingly hostile Segun Babatola phoned and introduce himself as Segun Babatola phoning in from Ado Ekiti. 

He poured a lot of vituperation and invectives against Chief Oguntuase, accusing him of feeding fat on the public by making fortunes from the petrol scarcity by diverting petrol to a station operated by him where he was selling petrol at an inflated price, rather than the controlled price at which he was to ensure that it was sold to the public. 

He refused to accept all the explanations offered by Chief Oguntuase that he did not operate any petrol station anywhere let alone sell petrol at inflated prices. 

At a stage when the exchanges were really hot, the Moderator asked Chief Oguntuase if he had previously known the person phoning and making the serious allegation and Chief Oguntuase answered  that he knew him as Segun Audu and not Segun Babatola and that he was actually the son of one Alhaji Audu who lived in the same area with him. After the programme, Segun Babatola commenced an action against Chief Oguntuase for defamation, contending that his Statement that he was Segun Audu rather than Segun Babatola amounted to calling him a bastard.

I was briefed by Chief Remi Oguntuase to defend the action. 
I applied to the Broadcasting Service of Ekiti State for a copy of the recording of the programme where the words complained about were allegedly uttered but the Moderator said it had been obliterated and was no longer available. 
I was shocked to note later during  the trial that the Moderator, as witness for the Plaintiff, on subpoena, came to court to tender the cassette on which he recorded the programme.

Chief Oguntuase briefed me comprehensively on the facts upon which he relied to say that he knew the Plaintiff as Segun Audu the son of one Alhaji Audu.
He even arranged for me to meet Alhaji Audu who told me that he was the reputed father of segun, now answering Segun Babatola and that as his father, he sent him to two Muslim primary schools and a Muslim Secondary School and also trained him at the Technical College, Kaduna before he heard that he changed  his name to Segun Babatola, claiming to be the son of one Chief J. E. Babatola, an Educationist and Politician, who once served as Minister in the Government of Western Region of Nigeria.

I pleaded all these facts in the Statement of Defence and denied that the Defendant called him a bastard but only said he knew him as Segun Audu rather than Segun Babatola by which he introduced himself on the programme. In the alternative, I pleaded the defence of justification in case the statement allegedly made by the defendant is held to be capable of conveying to the hearers the meaning that the Plaintiff was a bastard.

We further pleaded that at all material times, the Plaintiff's mother was married to Alhaji Audu and was never married to Chief Babatola whom he was claiming to be his father and his records in all institutions he attended showed his name as Segun Audu and his father as Alhaji Audu until he allegedly changed his name to Segun Babatola, claiming to be son of Chief Joel Ehinafe Babatola, the Olora of Ado -Ekiti. 

At the trial, the Moderator of the programme at which the words complained of were allegedly uttered by my client's was the first witness for the plaintiff who tendered the cassette of the recording on a subpoena duces tecum.
Then came the Plaintiff who stated that he was Segun Babatola but that the Defendant called him a bastard on the radio programme and that the statement of the Defendant lowered his reputation in the eyes of the public who heard the programme, which was listened to by a large audience of listeners in Ekiti and beyond.

Under cross-examination, I put it to him that his mother was married to Alhaji Audu as a spinster and lived with Alhaji Audu as his wife at the time of his birth and he agreed that it was true.
I also put it to him that Alhaji Audu named him at birth as Segun Audu, and he admitted that it was true.

I further put it to him that when he was of school age, Alhaji Audu as his father and as a Muslim sent him to the Ansar-Ud-Deen School, Ado -Ekiti and he was registered as Segun Audu, and he admitted that it was true.
I put it to him that as a Muslim, Alhaji Audu sent him to Ansar-ud-Deen High school, Ikole Ekiti for his secondary education and he was registered as Segun Audu, and he admitted that it was true.
He also admitted that after his Secondary School education, he attended the Government Technical College, Ado Ekiti and Higher Technical College, Kaduna, sponsored to both institutions by Alhaji Audu and registered as Segun Audu.

I put it to him that he had contact with Chief Babatola when the company in which he was working was seeking the assistance of Chief Babatola, then a Minister in the Government of Governor Adeyinka Adebayo in Western Nigeria and that it was Chief Babatola who told him that he was his biological father and persuaded him to change his name to Segun Babatola.

His answer was that it was not because of the contact that he changed his name. 
He however admitted that he got close to Chief Babatola during the time of the contact and subsequently changed his name.

I put it to him that the Defendant was right when he said he knew him as Segun Audu as he might not have seen the newspaper publishing his change of name but they rejected the suggestion saying that the Defendant knew that he had changed his name. He; however, admitted that many of his schoolmates in primary and secondary school as well as technical College who did not read the Newspaper publication would still only know him as Segun Audu.
He admitted that Chief Babatola was never married to his mother but he was a product of concubinage between Chief Babatola and his mother.
He admitted that at all times relevant to this matter, Alhaji Audu was the husband of the mother who was never married to Chief Babatola but rejected the suggestion that if anyone called him a bastard, he would be right.

His next witness was Chief Joel Ehinafe Babatola, a retired Principal, a former Parliamentary Secretary and former Minister in the Government of Chief Obafemi Awolowo as well as the Government of Brigadier General Adeyinka Adebayo.

In his evidence, he testified that he was the biological father of the plaintiff although he was no at any time married to his mother. He told the court that he was interested in marrying the Plaintiff's mother as a spinster but that the parents of the plaintiff's mother, being Muslims, preferred that she should marry Alhaji Audu, a Muslim like them, but he was the one whose sexual intercourse with her resulted in the birth of the Plaintiff.
He testified further that when the Plaintiff  came of age, he told him about their relationship and requested that the Plaintiff should change his name from that of Audu to Segun Babatola.

He tendered a copy of the Newspaper publication in which the Plaintiff changed his name from Segun Audu to Segun Babatola which was admitted as an exhibit.
He testified that since the time of the publication, the Plaintiff had been answering Segun Babatola.

Under cross-examination, the witness agreed that not all Nigerians buy and read copies of the Daily Times  everyday.
He also agreed  that those who did not read the Newspaper would not know about the Plaintiff's change of name from Segun Audu to Segun Babatola.
I then put it to him that at the time he said he wanted to marry the Plaintiff's mother and had sexual relationship with the mother which resulted in his birth, he was already married to one former Miss Familoni, a native of Ido Ekiti and he admitted that it was true.
I also put it to him that the marriage was contracted in a church under the Marriage Act, and he admitted that it was true.
He also admitted that his marriage to former Miss Familoni had produced grown up children, one of which was a Medical Doctor and another was a graduate teacher.

I put it to him that he could not have married the Plaintiff's mother at the time of his conception, having been married under the statute, which does not admit of his taking another wife, but he stated that he truly wanted to marry her.
I asked the witness if he knew that he would  have committed the offence of bigamy, if he married the Plaintiff's mother after his statutory marriage but the court disallowed the question.

I then asked him if he knew that the complaint of the Plaintiff was that the Defendant called him a bastard and he said he knew.
I asked him if he knew the meaning of bastard and he said he did not know.
I gave him three dictionaries of English Language as well as Black's Law Dictionary to read the meaning of the word bastard.
I then put it to him that any child born of a father who was not married to the mother was a bastard but he said he did not know.
I also put it to him that since he was not the husband of the Plaintiff's mother at the time of the conception of the Plaintiff, anyone who called the Plaintiff a bastard would not be wrong, but he said he would not know.
I finally put it to him that the Plaintiff was indeed a bastard and he refused to admit. 
I then modified the question and put it to him, that if the Defendant referred to the Plaintiff as a bastard, he would not be wrong but he refused to agree that he would be correct.

At that stage, I closed my cross-examination of the witnesses. After the evidence of the witness,  the trial Judge asked the Plaintiff and his counsel if they would not like to review the case and make up their minds if they would continue the hearing of the case. They agreed to review the case and took a long adjournment to consider their position.

Before the next date of adjournment, they had filed a notice of discontinuance and the case struck out without any order as to costs.

3/18/22, 2:47 AM - Chinedu Madu: *No One is Without Talents: Flee from Envy*
_(Friday 18th March 2022. Read: Gen. 37:3-4,12-13,17-28, Ps. 105:16-21, Matthew 21:33-43,45-46)_ 

¬© Rev. Fr. Evaristus Abu

_*‚ÄúThey said to one another, ‚ÄòHere comes this dreamer. Come now, let us kill him and throw him into one of the pits; then we shall say that a wild beast has devoured him, and we shall see what will become of his dreams.‚Äô‚Äù (Genesis 37:19-20)*_

The parable of the householder who planted a vineyard teaches us a lesson; that God expects us to be fruitful. He knows what we are made of. If the householder had not planted rich seeds, he would not send people to ask for the fruits. God demands our fruits because he knows we can deliver. 

To be envious of others is to notice their gifts and develop hatred for them just because of what they have. It is seeing the light in others and trying by all means to quench it. This was the sad reality with Joseph and his brothers. It was also the sad reality between Jesus and those who were plotting to kill Him. As Nicodemus mentioned, these religious leaders knew that Jesus is God, they could not fault Jesus, but instead of accepting Jesus, they hated Him.

Thanks to the intervention of Judah, the brothers of Joseph brought him out of the pit and sold him to the Midianites for twenty shekels of silver. They thought that would be the end of his dreams, little did they know they were setting those dreams in motion. 

The tenants in the parable reasoned that by killing the son, the vineyard would become theirs. The religious leaders thought that by killing Jesus, that would be the end of Him not knowing that by so doing, they brought to fulfilment all that was said about Jesus. 

When we fight others out of envy, we only help to lift them up even more. Regardless of your hatred for a person, you cannot quench their light; you cannot stop them from achieving what God has planned for them. 

Flee from envy; hatred is blindness ‚Äì when you hate, you become blind to the treasures that God has deposited in you. Remember that both the razor blade and the axe can cut but while the razor cannot cut trees, the axe cannot shave beards. I would be doing a great disservice to God if, for instance, I a razor blade am envious of the axe just because I am not able to do what an axe can do. 

If you do not celebrate the gifts of others; no one will celebrate yours. If you try to pull people down, you will forever remain down. None of us is cheated by God. No human being is without special gifts and abilities. God has planted a vineyard in you and He expects to see your fruits. Watch out when you begin to criticize others continuously, you may simply be playing out your envy.

Let us pray: Lord Jesus, cleanse my heart from envy that I may discover my gifts. Save me from the envy of those who hate me and grant me victory over their plots. Amen.

*Be Happy. Live Positive. Have Faith. It is well with you. (Friday of the 2nd week of Lent. Bible Study: Gen. 37:3-4,12-13,17-28, Ps. 105:16-21, Matthew 21:33-43,45-46).*

3/18/22, 1:13 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Nigeria de fail big time on many fronts... and there seems to be little will power to rescue the country
3/18/22, 1:14 PM - Brume Ikogho: I haven't watched the video...but things are expensive because they're overinflated

3/18/22, 1:20 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Hi Guys,
Could you please help me with the following:
In an investment banking fundraising deal how much of the overall fee is shared by the lead banker with the co-lead?

E.g. if I‚Äôm lead and I get 5% for raising ¬£100m, but if I bring in a joint book runner and they raise ¬£30m, what % of fee usually payable to them?

Happy to get a range + also some reference if possible? Thanks.

3/18/22, 1:33 PM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Look at the fact that Nigerian airlines have to be insured abroad. He quoted Lloyd's Bank insuring their airlines and the cost being 3 times the costs of foreign Legacy aircrafts.
3/18/22, 1:34 PM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Some of these costs are because of the faulty system we are operating.
3/18/22, 1:34 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Of course
3/18/22, 1:34 PM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: The costs you are referring to is similar to that Onyema is referring to.
3/18/22, 1:34 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: My point exactly
3/18/22, 1:34 PM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Costs that exist because we are not using our home grown advantages.

3/19/22, 8:51 AM - Chinedu Madu: *St. Joseph: Perfect Example of a Just Man*
_(Saturday 19th March 2022. Read: 2 Sam. 7:4-5,12-14,16, Ps. 89:2-5,27,29, Romans 4:13,16-18,22, Matthew 1:16,18-21,24)_ 

_*‚ÄúBefore they came together she was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit; and her husband Joseph, being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly.‚Äù (Matthew 1:18-19)*_

Whenever we take a closer look at the person of Joseph, the husband of Mary, we soon realize that we tend to take St. Joseph for granted not because we like to ignore him but because we naturally assume Jesus alone deserves all our attention. There are a lot of lessons to learn from this great man, Joseph, some of which we would now try to itemize:

1. St. Joseph was a just man.
The Bible refers to Joseph as a just man. (Matthew 1:19). This means he was a man of integrity. He was well respected in the community. He had a good name. He was a man of justice. He was not a wayward person and he believed in doing what is right at all times. Can it be said about me that I am a just person? Do I practice selective integrity?

2. St. Joseph did not take joy in seeing the Pain of others.
St. Joseph was unwilling to put Mary to shame despite learning of her pregnancy before they came to be together as husband and wife. When I happen to suspect others of doing wrong, what is my immediate reaction? Do I keep things to myself or begin to gossip and announce to others?

3. St. Joseph was Obedient to God at his own expense.
We are told that when Joseph woke from sleep, he did as the Angel of the Lord had commanded him. He agreed to play the role of a foster father to the Son of God. This meant that he agreed to live as a celibate for the rest of his life for the sake of Jesus Christ. His own form of celibacy would even be more demanding given that unlike other celibates, he would have to live in the same house with Mary. Can I make a sacrifice for God? 

4. St. Joseph was a Man of Faith.
It takes great faith to agree to do what Joseph did for Jesus and Mary. Do you notice that God only spoke to him through dreams? It takes great faith to believe that what we see in our dreams is not simply a figment of our imagination. It takes Faith to believe that a young woman would conceive without knowing a man. Do I put a limit in my mind to what God can do? Do I really believe that with God, all things are possible? Am I willing to act based on what God reveals to me daily through my study of the scriptures?

In today‚Äôs second reading, St. Paul reminds us of Abraham, a man of faith, who hoped against hope that he would be the father of many nations and he was not disappointed in the end. St. Joseph too is a kind of Abraham; he believed the message of the Angel and agreed to be the earthly father of Jesus Christ, this way giving credence to the prophecy of Nathan which we read about in today‚Äôs first reading. An offspring from the house of David whose house shall be established forever.

Let us pray: Lord Jesus, may your earthly father, Joseph intercede for me. Amen

*Be Happy. Live Positive. Have Faith. It is well with you. (Saint Joseph, husband of the Blessed Virgin Mary ‚Äì Solemnity. Bible Study: 2 Sam. 7:4-5,12-14,16, Ps. 89:2-5,27,29, Romans 4:13,16-18,22, Matthew 1:16,18-21,24).*

3/22/22, 9:55 AM - Chinedu Madu: *Forgive: Do Not Keep Records of Past Offences*
_(Tuesday 22nd March 2022. Read: Daniel 3:2,11-20, Ps. 25:4-6,7a-9, Matthew 18:21-35)_ 

_*‚ÄúSo also, my heavenly Father will do to every one of you, if you do not forgive your brother from your heart.‚Äù (Matthew 18:35)*_

Peter had been hearing Jesus talk about forgiveness but like every Christian today, Peter was troubled: ‚ÄúShould I always forgive? If I keep forgiving my neighbour, wouldn‚Äôt I be indirectly saying it is okay for him or her to keep doing the same or even worse things? Shouldn‚Äôt there be a limit to how much I can forgive?‚Äù Peter came up and said to Jesus, ‚ÄúLord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? As many as seven times?‚Äù (Matthew 18:21)

Now, it is important to note that Peter‚Äôs question was with regard to a brother who admits his faults and comes begging for forgiveness. Luke‚Äôs version of this story gives us a clearer context. There, Jesus said: ‚ÄúTake heed to yourselves; if your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him; and if he sins against you seven times in the day, and turns to you seven times, and says, ‚ÄòI repent,‚Äô you must forgive him.‚Äù (Luke 17:3-4)

Honestly, forgiveness is one of the most difficult things to do even for a devoted Christian. Jesus is teaching us today to always forgive, especially when the offender comes to beg for pardon. By seeking our forgiveness, it means that the person recognizes that what he or she has done is wrong and there is some willingness on their part not to do it again. If eventually, they still do it and come to beg for our forgiveness, it means they still have a conscience. Jesus says: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt count how many times they come, just forgive ‚Äì so long as they say they are sorry.‚Äù

To illustrate his point, Jesus gave the parable of the unforgiving servant. For a person to come to you to beg and you still insist that he or she must be punished, it means you are saying to God that you do not deserve pardon for your sins. If you have pleaded with God for mercy, you should naturally forgive a brother who pleads for mercy. No matter how much pain we feel, we should not forget that we owe God more. The master said to his servant, ‚ÄúI forgave you all that debt because you besought me; and should not you have had mercy on your fellow servant, as I had mercy on you?‚Äù (Matthew 18:32-33)

However, it is a completely different ball game if they fail to admit their fault. If they insist that they are right, if they fail to say they are sorry, it means that if given the chance, they would do it again. In this instance, Jesus did not say we must forgive but He outlined the steps we are to take. ‚ÄúIf your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you (i.e. admits his fault), you have gained your brother. But if he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, that every word may be confirmed by the evidence of two or three witnesses. If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector.‚Äù (Matthew 18:15-17)

Why did Jesus outline these steps? It is very important that the offender is able to admit his or her faults. If a person does not see anything wrong with what he or she has done, forgiving them only enables them to do more. The Gospel truth is that it is not everyone that deserves forgiveness; some persons are meant to be treated like Gentiles or tax collectors because they know what they are doing is wrong but still do it. For instance, there is no point forgiving the devil. 

When Jesus forgave His killers, He begged on their behalf saying: ‚ÄúThey do not know what they are doing.‚Äù Jesus was sure that if only they knew, they would not have been so cruel to Him. Make efforts to forgive but do not be ashamed if you are not able to forgive but do not die in silence, that is, seek professional help, talk to someone, speak out. Seek healing for your pain and trauma, not revenge. Revenge is not only un-Christian, it does not cure your pain. Even if you were to kill your offender, you would still be traumatized if you do not seek professional help.

Let us pray: Lord Jesus, in moments of pain and hurt, let your Holy Spirit descend on me to know how best to act, touch my heart softly, heal my wounds that I may be strong enough to forgive. Amen

*Be Happy. Live Positive. Have Faith. It is well with you. (Tuesday of the 3rd Week of Lent. Bible Study: Daniel 3:2,11-20, Ps. 25:4-6,7a-9, Matthew 18:21-35).*

3/23/22, 2:24 AM - Chinedu Madu: *If You Trust God, You Will Obey Him.*
_(Wednesday 23rd March 2022. Read: Deut. 4:1,5-9, Ps. 147:12-13,15-16,19-20, Matthew 5:17-19)_ 

_*‚ÄúKeep them and do them; for that will be your wisdom and your understanding.‚Äù (Deuteronomy 4:6)*_

In today‚Äôs first reading, we hear Moses instructing the Israelite Nation: ‚ÄúAnd now, O Israel, give heed to the statutes and the ordinances which I teach you, and do them; that you may live, and go in and take possession of the land which the Lord, the God of your fathers, gives you.‚Äù (Deuteronomy 4:1). Moses told them: ‚Äúdo them (i.e., obey the commandments); that you may live, and go in and take possession of the land‚Ä¶‚Äù

There is surely a connection between our obedience to God and the quality of our lives. Do you desire to be very successful in life? Then, do not disregard God. To get a clearer understanding of this fact, let us consider what God said to Joshua shortly after the death of Moses: ‚ÄúThis book of the law shall not depart out of your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it; for then you shall make your way prosperous, and then you shall have good success.‚Äù (Joshua 1:8). In other words, obedience to God produces success.

Jesus also expresses this very fact during the Sermon on the Mount: ‚ÄúDo not be anxious, saying, ‚ÄòWhat shall we eat?‚Äô or ‚ÄòWhat shall we drink?‚Äô or ‚ÄòWhat shall we wear?‚Äô ‚Ä¶ Seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things shall be yours as well.‚Äù (Matthew 6:31-33). To seek righteousness is to strive consciously every day to think, speak and act right in accordance with God‚Äôs words. To seek righteousness is to grow daily in the fear of God, being careful to avoid sin at all cost.

The question is: ‚Äúwhy is it so difficult to keep God‚Äôs words?‚Äù Firstly, we do not love God. Jesus told us: ‚ÄúIf you love me, you will keep my commandments.‚Äù (John 14:15) If our love for God is genuine, we would do all it takes to obey Him, without counting the cost. The letter to the Hebrews states: ‚ÄúIn your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood.‚Äù (Hebrews 12:4). 

Secondly, we find it difficult to obey God‚Äôs words because we do not trust God. Deep within us, we do not believe there is any value in keeping God‚Äôs commandments. Somehow, we have come to believe the lie of the devil, that by ‚Äúeating of the fruit‚Äù we would not die but our eyes would be open, we would be like God. The bottom line of all these evils happening in our society today is that we no longer trust God‚Äôs ability to bless us with genuine wealth and prosperity if we seek righteousness. Indeed, we no longer believe that God exists.

Child of God, as you hear (or read) these words, do not harden your heart. Renew your trust in God; believe that there are uncountable blessings that come with obedience to God; believe that you will never regret whatever sacrifice you make to keep God‚Äôs words; believe that no one can ever worship God in vain ‚Äì ‚Äúthat He is a rewarder of all who diligently seek Him.‚Äù (Hebrews 11:6). Anyone who tells you that you have to contribute money to the church before God will bless is a liar and a thief. The only seed that God demands is to let your light shine, to walk in righteousness, to avoid sin, and love your neighbour as yourself.

In conclusion, Jesus tells us today: ‚ÄúWhoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.‚Äù (Matthew 5:19)

Let us pray: Lord Jesus, increase my trust in you and help me to obey. Amen

*Be Happy. Live Positive. Have Faith. It is well with you. (Wednesday of the 3rd week of Lent. Bible Study: Deut. 4:1,5-9, Ps. 147:12-13,15-16,19-20, Matthew 5:17-19).*

1. Why was the lady locked in leaving and her only option was scaling the fence?
2. Isn't she entitled to a key to the gate?
3. If SIM (even including phone) is the issue, she could easily toss the damn SIM with the phone into the lagoon and claim she was robbed rather than risk her life this way.

Abi she see heavy juju with plenty human heads....

Everything anything  is possible.

 It seems he was watching her on a recorded CCTV footage (not live).....hence this "escape" happened when he was sleeping or away from home ...... Na escape that woman escape so.... She fit don see/hear wetin she nor suppose see/hear...hence she gbaga. The man fit just make that video to counter what ever "truth" she might have to say thereafter.

Una funny o....Which wife go jump fence go doke when husband dey house dey sleep..for night o?ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£.... If husband nor dey house, na to stroll pass gate comot na

3/26/22, 9:23 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: "According to Psychologists, there are four types of Intelligence: 

1) Intelligence Quotient (IQ)
2) Emotional Quotient (EQ)
3) Social Quotient (SQ)
4) Adversity Quotient (AQ)

1. Intelligence Quotient (IQ): this is the measure of your level of comprehension. You need IQ to solve maths, memorize things, and recall lessons.

2. Emotional Quotient (EQ): this is the measure of your ability to maintain peace with others, keep to time, be responsible, be honest, respect boundaries, be humble, genuine and considerate.

3. Social Quotient (SQ): this is the measure of your ability to build a network of friends and maintain it over a long period of time.

People that have higher EQ and SQ tend to go further in life than those with a high IQ but low EQ and SQ. Most schools capitalize on improving IQ levels while EQ and SQ are played down.

A man of high IQ can end up being employed by a man of high EQ and SQ even though he has an average IQ.

Your EQ represents your Character, while your SQ represents your Charisma. Give in to habits that will improve these three Qs, especially your EQ and SQ.

Now there is a 4th one, a new paradigm:

4. The Adversity Quotient (AQ): The measure of your ability to go through a rough patch in life, and come out of it without losing your mind.

When faced with troubles, AQ determines who will give up, who will abandon their family, and who will consider suicide.

Parents please expose your children to other areas of life than just Academics. They should adore manual labour (never use work as a form of punishment), Sports and Arts.

Develop their IQ, as well as their EQ, SQ and AQ. They should become multifaceted human beings able to do things independently of their parents.

Finally, do not prepare the road for your children. Prepare your children for the road."

_(Saturday 26th March 2022. Read: Hosea 5:15-6:6, Ps. 51:3-4,18-21, Luke 18:9-14)_ 

_*‚ÄúFor I desire steadfast love and not sacrifice, the knowledge of God, rather than burnt offerings.‚Äù (Hosea 6:6)*_

I guess you may have heard the story of the woman who told her parish priest that she was going to quit her membership of the Church. The priest felt very concerned and asked her the reason for her rash decision. The woman then went on to narrate all the evils that the church members were doing. She had something bad to say about everyone. Not even the priest was spared. She concluded by saying: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I can continue worshipping God in this filthy place.‚Äù

‚ÄúBefore you go, there is something I would like you to do for me,‚Äù said the priest. The priest then gave her a glass cup filled with water saying: ‚ÄúTake the glass cup and walk to the sanctuary and back here. Do not let a single drop of water spill from this glass.‚Äù She took the glass cup, held it gently with her two hands, and walked up to the sanctuary and back.

When she returned to the priest, he congratulated her for not spilling a single drop, then he asked her: ‚ÄúWhile you were walking with this glass cup, did you notice anyone gossiping, not properly dressed, reading a newspaper, pressing their phones inside the church and so on?‚Äù She said: ‚ÄúNo, Father. How could I have noticed when I was trying not to spill the water?‚Äù 

The priest then said: ‚ÄúConsider this cup to be Christ. When you come to church, let your attention be on Christ and not on your fellow Christians‚Äù Like this woman, a lot of us Christians have become puffed up with pride because we believe we are better than everyone else. Some even go as far as narrating the sins of others during the sacrament of penance while maintaining that they themselves are sinless. As much as we wish the Church was a gathering only of saints, we must accept the reality that the church is also a hospital where the sick and wounded come in seeking healing.

In today‚Äôs Gospel passage, Luke tells us that Jesus told a ‚Äúparable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised others.‚Äù (Luke 18:9) One of the symptoms of pride is trusting in ourselves rather than in God, forgetting that our righteousness is a product of grace, not personal efforts. The Pharisee was so puffed up by pride that he ended up praying to himself; that is to say: his prayer did not reach God‚Äôs ears since it was merely a boast. 

Pride not only prevents our prayer from rising to heaven, it also attracts the wrath of God. In Jeremiah 50:31-32, we read: ‚ÄúBehold, I am against you, O proud one, says the Lord God of hosts; for your day has come, the time when I will punish you. The proud one shall stumble and fall, with none to raise him up, and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it will devour all that is round about him.‚Äù

Meanwhile, the tax collector who didn‚Äôt even lift his eyes to heaven went home justified. Jesus concluded the parable saying: ‚ÄúFor everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted.‚Äù (Luke 18:14). Both St. James and St. Peter remind us: ‚ÄúGod opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble.‚Äù (James 4:6 & 1 Peter 5:5). 

In conclusion, St. Paul teaches us: ‚ÄúGod chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise, God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong, God chose what is low and despised in the world, even things that are not, to bring to nothing things that are, so that no human being might boast in the presence of God.‚Äù (1 Corinthians 1:27-29)

Let us pray: Lord Jesus, teach me to examine my conscience; to lift others up rather than look down on them. Amen.

*Be Happy. Live Positive. Have Faith. It is well with you. (Saturday of the 3rd week of Lent. Bible Study: Hosea 5:15-6:6, Ps. 51:3-4,18-21, Luke 18:9-14).*

3/27/22, 12:46 AM - Chinedu Madu: *Home Sweet Home: Truly, there is No Place Like Home*
_(Sunday 27th March 2022. Read: Joshua 5:9-12, Ps. 34:2-7, 2 Cor. 5:17-21, Luke 15:1-3,11-32)_ 

_*‚ÄúFather, I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son; treat me as one of your hired servants.‚Äù (Luke 15:18-19)*_

On this fourth Sunday of Lent, we are called to return home. This call is echoed deeply in the voice of the prodigal son who upon coming to his senses, said to himself: ‚ÄúI will arise and go to my father.‚Äù (Luke 15:18). The hunger of the prodigal son reflects that deep longing in us which no earthly food can satisfy, that hunger for which St. Augustine writes: ‚ÄúOur hearts are restless until they rest in God.‚Äù

The call to return home is foreshadowed in our first reading, wherein we see the people of Israel under the leadership of Joshua finally settling down in Gilgal. For the first time after four hundred years, they were no longer to feed on manna but on the fruit of the land of Canaan; the land flowing with Milk and Honey. Manna was a symbol of their rebellion in the desert, a symbol of sojourning across the desert.  There are so many lessons for us to take home today: 

*1. We are simply Pilgrims on Earth*
Being heavenly-bound, we too are on a journey through a desert. Think of all the problems the world is facing today, listen to the news and you cannot but realize we are in a desert. All the world has to offer us is manna at its very best and this is why Jesus was not carried away by Satan‚Äôs offer of earthly kingdoms. Jesus knew that all the kingdoms of the world are deserts compared to the glory of heaven.

The prodigal son represents that desire in us to grab and grab the material pleasures of the world. That he squandered all he had within a short time shows that all that the world has to offer only lasts for a short time; money reduces in value, beauty fades, things get broken, fame diminishes, love soon turns to hate and so on‚Ä¶ In fact, nothing lasts forever on earth! We must never lose sight of our true home; heaven.

*2. Every Sin is a Prodigal Act*
Every time, we value the things of this world over and above God, we are acting very much like the prodigal son. Sin always looks very attractive and beneficial at the beginning and God respects our freedom if we choose to go in that direction. But no sooner had we fallen, we realise the pain and sorrow of our foolishness. 

In the end, that which promised us lasting enjoyment away from the father‚Äôs presence soon turns into starvation and misery and it dawns on us that we would have been better off in the father‚Äôs house; that is, within the comfort zone of obeying God‚Äôs commandments. Quite often, like children standing in front of their father‚Äôs compound, the grass is always greener in their neighbour‚Äôs compound. We tend to believe that there is something to be gained from sin and instead of appreciating where we are in God, we begin to see God‚Äôs house as burdensome. 

*3. Sin Reduces Us to the Level of Slaves*
Sin not only destroys the life of God inside us, but it also takes away our dignity by making us think less of ourselves. Like the prodigal son who forgot who he was and hired himself out as a farmworker, sin gives us a low image of ourselves. The more we sin, the less we think we can overcome temptations. 

No matter how deep we may have engrossed ourselves in sin, no matter how much pig food we may have consumed, we still have the capacity to return home. Hence St. Paul encourages us in today‚Äôs second reading: ‚Äúif any man is in Christ, he is a new creation, the old has passed away; the new has come‚Ä¶ For our sake, (God) made him to be sin who knew no sin, that that in him we might become the righteousness of God.‚Äù (2nd Corinthians 5:17&21)

*4. Pretence is a Silent Killer*
Both the younger son and the older one had the same problem; they were no longer satisfied with what they had. While the younger son decided to explore what was out there, the elder son kept to himself. He too longed to go out but he wanted his father to give him a go-ahead, his obedience was not genuine. This was why he felt cheated when the younger son returned. 

He felt the boy only went out there to ‚Äúenjoy.‚Äù Many of us are like the older brother, we strive to avoid sin, yet deep down within us, we believe there is something to gain by committing sin. Our obedience becomes a matter of pretence rather than a matter of conviction. It is not enough that we avoid sin, we must never envy those who engross themselves in sin. Do you lack a sense of joy keeping God‚Äôs commandments? Then it is time to repent and return home.

*5. God Eagerly Awaits Our Return*
Just as the Father gave a great banquet for the prodigal son, so is God going to give a great banquet for all sinners who change their ways and return to Him. There is more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine who have no need of repentance. Jesus says: ‚ÄúBut while he (the prodigal son) was yet at a distance, his father saw him and had compassion, and ran and embraced him and kissed him.‚Äù (Luke 15:20). 

Imagine someone told you that your only child who had been sick for a while is dead only for you to rush to the hospital and meet that child alive. Think of the joy that would fill your heart seeing that child alive, this is the joy that fills God‚Äôs heart when we repent. Twice Jesus quoted the Father as saying: ‚Äúfor this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found‚Ä¶ for this your brother was dead and is alive; he was lost, and is found.‚Äù (Luke 15:24&32) To sin is to die and be lost. 

Let us pray: Lord Jesus, I shall leave this place and return to you. Grant me the grace of true repentance. Amen.

*Be Happy. Live Positive. Have Faith. It is well with you. (4th Sunday of Lent ‚Äì Year C. Bible Study: Joshua 5:9-12, Ps. 34:2-7, 2 Cor. 5:17-21, Luke 15:1-3,11-32).*

INTRODUCTION OF CONSTITUTIONAL AND OTHER MAJOR CHANGES IN NIGERIAN POLITICS

*He was the first gubernatorial candidate in Nigeria to legally challenge to its logical conclusion, his governorship electoral victory that was denied him. He won in the Courts and reclaimed his mandate.

*He was the first Governor in Nigeria to legally challenge his wrongful impeachment and was reinstated by the Courts.

*He was the first Governor in Nigeria to seek the interpretation of tenures of Governors when INEC allowed elections to take place in Anambra State when his tenure had not expired; the election already concluded was cancelled and he was allowed to complete his tenure.

*He was the first Governor to serve a 2nd term in both the new and old Anambra State, that is, almost 40 years after creation of the State.

*He was the first Governor, whilst still in Office, to be appointed a Special Adviser to the President.

*He was the first serving Governor to be appointed into the Presidential Economic Management Team.

*He was among the first Governors to be honoured with a National Award in 2011, while still in office.

*Though the only Governor whose political party was in government in only one State,  he was elected Vice-Chairman of the Nigeria Governors‚Äô Forum twice.

*Though the only non-PDP Governor in the South-East (made up of 5 States), he was elected by the other 4 PDP Governors as their Chairman for 8 years rather than the usual one year.

FUNDAMENTAL ACHIEVEMENTS AS GOVERNOR OF ANAMBRA STATE (PARTIAL LISTING)

1. Anambra was the first State to commence Sub-Sovereign Wealth savings, the first of its kind in Sub-Saharan Africa. At a time many other Governors were leaving huge debts, I left the equivalent of $500 million Dollars in investment as well as local and foreign currency, including $156 million in Dollar-denominated bonds.

2. For the first time in the history of Anambra State, Ambassadors and High Commissioners of notable countries such as United Stated, Britain, Russia, European Union, South Africa, Belgium, Israel, the Netherlands, Canada, among others, visited the State. Before my tenure, Anambra was practically a pariah state blacklisted by the Diplomatic Corps and international development partners.

3. Development partners such as UNDP, UNICEF, the World Bank, DFID, the European Union etc., which hitherto were not in Anambra State started working with the State. Anambra was consistently adjudged one of the best states in development partnership and commitment to reforms for good governance.

4. He was recognised as Best Governor by the Millennium Development Goals Office (OSSAP-MDGs) and the UNDP in the implementation of their programmes in Nigeria.

5. The Nigerian Debt Management Office (DMO) rated Anambra as the least indebted state in Nigeria. In spite of visible and measurable achievements recorded in various sectors, the State under him did not borrow or raise bonds for her various projects.

6. The Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria rated Anambra State as the most financially stable state in the country.

7. The State's ground-breaking return of schools to their original owners - Voluntary Agencies (Churches) on 1st January 2009, and subsequent partnership with the Agencies in Education, saw the State move from 24th position out of 36 States to Number One in National Examination Council (NECO) and West African Examination Council (WAEC) examinations for three consecutive years. This made the World Bank to commission a study, led by the renowned Prof. Paul Collier of Oxford University, on this revolutionary partnership and phenomenal achievement.

8. The State also entered into strategic partnership with the Churches in the Health sector. This symbiotic relationship resulted in a tremendous boost to health care because of the services offered by health institutions owned by Voluntary Agencies, while the State restored grants to the agencies and made available to them more than 50 million Dollars in various types of support.

10. Through partnership with the Church in the Health sector, his Government funded the transformation of -:

a: Iyienu Hospital, Ogidi; 
b: Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Ihiala; 
c: St Charles Borromeo Hospital, Onitsha; 
d: Holy Rosary Hospital, Waterside, Onitsha; and 
e: St. Joseph Hospital, Adazi-Nnukwu. 
His Government also built the Joseph Nwilo Heart Centre in St. Joseph, Adazi-Nnukwu, where heart operations are now being performed.

11. His Government won the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (1 Million dollars) as the best-performing state in immunisation in the South-East. With complementary funding from our Government, they used the money to build 10 Maternal and Child Care Centres across the State, particularly in rural communities, in partnership with the Churches.

12. The State was the first to procure and distribute more than 30,000 computers to secondary schools, including 22,500 from HP. The Managing Director for Personal Systems Group HP Inc, Mr. FabriceCampoy described the deployment as the biggest  of such projects in the Middle-East and Africa.

13. Anambra State Government provided Microsoft Academies to more than 500 secondary schools, which the Head of Microsoft in Nigeria (Mr. Ken Span) described as the biggest such deployment in Africa so far.

14. The State provided Internet access to more than 500 secondary schools, which the CEO of Galaxy Backbone (Mr. Gerald Ilukwe) characterized as incomparable to any in the country.

15. More than 700 buses were provided to secondary schools in the State by our Government.

16. Boreholes were provided in schools all over the State.

17. Numerous classrooms were built in all the 177 communities of the State.

18 As part of the efforts to turn around the economy of the State, a number of companies were attracted to build their facilities in the Anambra State. A case in point is SABMiller, the 2nd largest brewery in the world, which built their first Green Field facility in the State, which is today one of the most successful facilities they operate globally.

19. A number of other companies followed the SABMiller initiative and were all supported and encouraged under our Government; a good example is INNOSON Motor Manufacturing Company, from which our government bought more than 1,000 vehicles.

20. Anambra State for the first time started close collaboration with recognized government security agencies (the Police, Army, Navy, Department of State Security, Civil Defence, among others), offering them various types of support including provision of more than 500 security vehicles. The improvement in security was phenomenal, such that the former IG of Police (Abubakar Mohammed) lauded Anambra State for not witnessing any bank robbery in my last three years in office.

21. To further enhance security, Anambra State provided at least one security vehicle to each of all the 177 communities in the State as well as various organizations such as markets and Churches.

22. His Administration conceived and built, from scratch, the first state-owned Teaching Hospital, Chukwuemeka Odumegwu-Ojukwu teaching Hospital, Awka.

23. His Government commenced the planned development of the Igbariam Campus of the ChukwuemekaOdumegwu-Ojukwu University, including the fencing, construction of internal roads, electrification, construction of the Faculty of Law, Auditorium, Administrative Block, Faculty of Agriculture, Management Building, among others).

24. His Government attracted the World Bank support on erosion - National Erosion and Watershed Management Project (NEWMAP) - to Anambra State.

25. His Government was the first to do Poverty Mapping in Nigeria, as a guide for the effective implementation of our poverty-alleviation strategies.

26 His Government, for the first time, undertook the aerial mapping of Awka as well as the production of Structure Plans for Awka Capital Territory, Onitsha and Nnewi.

27. During his tenure and with his Government's support, Anambra State became an oil producing State.

28. He built the first Secretariat Complex to house State Government Ministries that were hitherto scattered around the State.

29. His government commenced the development of the 'Three Arms Zone' comprising Government House/Governor‚Äôs Lodge, Legislative Building/Speakers Residence, and Judiciary Building with Chief Judge‚Äôs Residence.

30. By the end of his tenure in 2014, more than twelve (12) health institutions, including two hospitals, had secured accreditation; when we took off in 2006, no health institution in Anambra State was duly accredited.

31. Anambra State was the first to undergo national peer review, which scrutinised State Governments for good governance, through the State Peer Review Mechanism (SPRM), an initiative of the Nigerian Governors‚Äô Forum in collaboration with the DFID.

3/29/22, 2:31 AM - Osho Akagbosu L: Correct update
3/29/22, 6:42 AM - Chinedu Madu: *Sin no more that Nothing Worse may Befall You.*
_(Tuesday 29th March 2022. Read: Ezekiel 47:1-9,12, Ps. 46:2-3,5-6,8-9ab, John 5:1-3,5-16)_ 

_*‚ÄúNow the man who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, as there was a crowd in the place. Afterward, Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him, "See, you are well! Sin no more, that nothing worse befall you.‚Äù (John 5:13-14)*_

To the man Jesus healed by the pool of Bethzatha, he said: ‚ÄúSee, you are well! Sin no more, that nothing worse befall you.‚Äù In a similar vein, to those who told Jesus about the Galileans whose blood Pilate mixed with their sacrifices, he said: ‚ÄúDo you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans because they suffered thus? I tell you, no; but unless you repent you will all likewise perish...‚Äù (Luke 13:2-5).

As much as God is not interested in the death of the sinner, the truth is that there is something about sin itself that predisposes us to danger. As we see in the story of the prodigal son, sin takes us away from the Father‚Äôs house; it removes us from the protective embrace of God. We soon find ourselves at the mercy of the devil and his agents like the son who hired himself to strangers who wouldn‚Äôt even give him food to eat.

Jesus warned the man who had been cured to avoid sin so that nothing worse would happen to him. What else could be worse than suffering for thirty-eight years? What else could be worse than spending half of your lifespan in pain, discomfort, and misery? What could be worse than living with utter bitterness? This is exactly what sin does to us. The book of Proverbs says: ‚ÄúCan a man carry fire in his bosom and his clothes not be burned? Or can one walk upon hot coals and his feet not be scorched?‚Äù (Proverbs 6:27-28).

Jesus asked the man a simple question, ‚ÄúDo you want to be healed?‚Äù This is a very important question. It is a question that Jesus is also addressing to us: ‚ÄúDo you want to come out of that life of unnecessary pain and sorrow?‚Äù As terrible as sin is, there comes a time we become so used to sin that we begin to enjoy that which should ordinarily give us sleepless nights. We reach a point when we assume it is impossible to live differently.

Even though this man did not answer Jesus directly, his response was ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù He told Jesus how he had often tried without success to get into the water once it is stirred. For thirty-eight years the man remained there ‚Äúhoping against hope‚Äù that one day, he would enter the pool before anyone else. You may have been trying unsuccessfully to overcome the same sin. Don‚Äôt give up. You may have failed countless times but let your answer to Jesus‚Äô question remain: ‚ÄúYes, I want to be healed.‚Äù

One of the effects of sin is guilt ‚Äì the feeling that we have become worthless creatures; unworthy of love and respect; unworthy even of God‚Äôs presence. The prodigal son tried to convince his own Father to employ him as one of his hired servants. Sin reduces the desire to pray in us. We start telling ourselves that God is too holy to listen to us meanwhile it is during such moments of guilt that we ought to pray more and be in God‚Äôs house. That is when we should bathe ourselves in the river of God‚Äôs mercy.

In today‚Äôs first reading, God opened the eyes of Ezekiel to see a river flowing from the sanctuary of the temple. God said to him: ‚ÄúThis water flows toward the eastern region and goes down into the Arabah; and when it enters the stagnant waters of the sea, the water will become fresh. And wherever the river goes every living creature which swarms will live, and there will be very many fish; for this water goes there, that the waters of the sea may become fresh; so everything will live where the river goes.‚Äù (Ezekiel 47:8-9). 

Let us pray: May we drink this water and become fresh again. Amen. May the dry bones of holiness within us receive life again. Amen. May this supernatural water deepen our hatred of sin and renew our resolve to receive healing from the wounds of sin. Amen. 

*Be Happy. Live Positive. Have Faith. It is well with you. (Tuesday of the 4th week of Lent - Proper Readings. Bible Study: Ezekiel 47:1-9,12, Ps. 46:2-3,5-6,8-9ab, John 5:1-3,5-16).*

3/30/22, 6:41 PM - Lazarus Owobu: Let's settle this like American's - in court. Might be better to make them feel it where it hurts the most - the bank account. The Academy failed to protect Rock and provide a safe work environment, the security company failed to prevent Smith from accessing the stage and didn't remove him from the venue after the attack, Smith committed a crime against Rock and caused him to suffer pain, suffering, public humiliation, emotional and psychological trauma. The event medical company failed to provide immediate medical attention after the attack even though Bob Saget recently died of a lesser head impact. Whole lot of gross negligence and liability floating around just waiting to have a judgement brought against it. Probably low 9 figure suit with a high 8 figure settlement.
3/30/22, 6:42 PM - Lazarus Owobu: Na real American thinking be this. Thank God for Will and The Academy say Chris no ready for wahala.
3/30/22, 7:00 PM - +44 7405 094706: Una wan cancel company now for person mistake? Will is an adult and he should be held accountable for his actions
3/30/22, 7:07 PM - Frank Bello: The Academy has initiated disciplinary proceedings against Will Smith for "inappropriate physical contact, abusive or threatening behavior, and compromising the integrity of the Academy." He was also "asked to leave the ceremony and refused." https://t.co/27695ShzhH

3/30/22, 9:03 PM - Lazarus Owobu: Yes because they have set rules and the rules were broken couple with the allegation that he refused to leave when he was asked. 
The 2nd thing is if action is not taking someonelse can sue that city for failing them or not protecting the public against angry /violent individual.
3/30/22, 9:04 PM - Lazarus Owobu: The minor thing here is a law has been broken.

3/30/22, 9:45 PM - Chidozie Iriogbele: The biggest jump in the ruble occurred when the Russian president announced that unfriendly countries ‚Äî the European Union, the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan ‚Äî would have to pay in rubles for Russian gas.
 
If European countries are forced to agree to it, they will have to exchange euros and dollars for rubles. This will create a big global demand for rubles, leading to a further rise in its value against the dollar and the euro. The ruble is used largely to settle domestic transactions in Russia.
3/30/22, 9:47 PM - Chidozie Iriogbele: @Sly, please did you send the link about the UAE-Saudi joint statement condemning the Ukraine war and pledging to deal in USD ?

*Copied!*

God just exposed the  corruption in the railway ticketing,  no wonder that  they don't want to introduce online booking, when it was eventually introduced, it was always said to have been fully booked especially the business class. Currently,  they are having problems with the Chinese  bc the Chinese want to be running the train and to introduce real online booking   !!!

Now 970 were on board of the attacked train  but only  398 were on the manifest. 

From my inbox :

NRC SCAM:
398 tickets sold
372 of ticket holders boarded.
Head count is 970 on board.
Do you now see why it took NRC 56 hours to produce the manifest?
Even this figures are unbelievable.
They are doctored.
A thorough audit (forensic) will reveal that not up to 150 ticket fares were remitted to the government coffers.
A whooping 820 fares are stolen.
Let us assume the fare is N2000.
That will be N1.64m per trip. A minimum of 4 trips a day will be N6.56m.
In one month N196.8m going to someone's pocket.
Yet, we pay him salary, give him a car, give him a cook and gardner, pay for his vacation.
All he does is to do this to us.
The minister is on media cursing us for not giving him N3b for some bogus security nonsense. 

Evil people everywhere !!!

Terrible corruption. !!!

4/1/22, 4:05 AM - Osa Eweka: Happy New Month Of April.

APRIL is from the Latin word Aprilis which is from the Latin verb aprire meaning "to open". 

This month is named April because it is the month flowers and trees begin to open up after snow in the northern hemisphere. 

It marks the beginning of new life, hope and beauty. This is the month of the great mystery - the Pascal mystery. 

May Christ suffering, death and resurrection for us never be in vain. 

May God heal our world and bless us with peace. 

Wishing you a blessed and fruitful month of April. 

Happy new month with prayers for fulfillment of God‚Äôs Wishes For You & Your Heart Desires. AMEN

4/2/22, 12:15 AM - Chinedu Madu: *Be Courageous; Stand for the Truth*
_(Saturday 2nd April 2022. Read Jer. 11:18-20, Ps. 7:2-3,9-12, John 7:40-52)_ 

_*‚ÄúIs not this the man whom they seek to kill? And here he is, speaking openly, and they say nothing to him! Can it be that the authorities really know that this is the Christ?‚Äù (John 7:25-26)*_

As humans, we are social animals; we tend to blend with others socially. Due to our desire to be accepted, praised, and respected in whatever group we belong to, we tend to ‚Äúplay by the rules‚Äù that is to say, we tend to go with the flow even when it is sometimes against our individual opinion or conscience.

May God deliver us from the spirit of cowardice that we may stand by the truth even if we are the only ones left standing. Amen.

Some officers were sent to arrest Jesus and upon getting there, they were captivated by Jesus‚Äô preaching. As they listened to Jesus, their hatred for him melted, they no longer saw Jesus as a public enemy deserving of death. They went back to report to the chief priests and Pharisees: ‚ÄúNo man has ever spoken like this man.‚Äù These officers displayed unusual courage. 

May God so touch the hearts of those who may have heard negative reports about us and have been sent to do us harm to repent. Amen. 

Nicodemus also displayed great courage by reminding the chief priests and Pharisees of the law which states that a person is assumed innocent until he is proven guilty. ‚ÄúDoes our law judge a man without first giving him a hearing and learning what he does?‚Äù Nicodemus could have kept quiet but he knew the truth. He knew that Jesus is God.

May God give us the courageous spirit of Nicodemus to speak the truth and not be carried away by the popular opinion of whatever group we belong to. Amen.

Jeremiah teaches us a very important lesson in today‚Äôs first reading. He did not pray for the death of his enemies, nor did he command God to send down fire to consume them. Jeremiah prayed that God who is a just judge would Himself look into the matter and execute judgment according to His Will. A clear conscience fears no accusation. If your heart is pure, you are not afraid of your persecutors because you know the God you serve. You do not take up arms to fight because you trust that God knows how to take care of your adversaries.

May we like Jeremiah not back down on our goodness just because of the stones we receive from others. Amen.

Let us pray: Lord Jesus, increase my courage to stand for what is right and free me from all bitterness especially when I face persecution for your sake. Amen.

*Be Happy. Live Positive. Have Faith. It is well with you. (Saturday of the 4th week of Lent. Bible Study: Jer. 11:18-20, Ps. 7:2-3,9-12, John 7:40-52).*

4/2/22, 2:41 PM - Osa Eweka: Dear Member,

The U.S. Mission Nigeria is calling for applications from qualified candidates for the 2022-2023 Opportunity Funds Scholars Program.  We believe that there are many talented economically disadvantaged students in Nigeria who lack only financial resources and access to information to better their educational futures.  Over the years, we have worked closely with over 150 highly talented and highly motivated senior secondary students from low-income backgrounds to assist them in negotiating and financing the application process for admission to colleges and universities in the United States. 
 

We are writing to ask for your assistance in identifying highly talented, motivated, economically disadvantaged recent graduates in your locality who have completed a bachelor's and/or master's degree with a first-class, who would be interested in studying in the USA. We are looking for students who have the potential of succeeding, students with relevant research or teaching experience, especially in STEM fields, who are academically exceptional but financially disadvantaged.  

The program is very competitive ‚Äì last year, we received over 2,500 applications for the undergraduate program but selected only 34 students. Profiles of past scholars can be found here:
 www.opportunityfundsnigeria.org 


We will work with shortlisted students through regular seminars to assist them throughout the application process to secure admission and scholarships for colleges and universities in the United States for August 2023.  For this reason, it is essential that the students are within traveling distance of our offices here in Lagos/Abuja or can make arrangements to be in Lagos or Abuja for Opportunity Funds Program meetings and during the year, mainly this summer holiday starting in June 2022, through December 31, 2022.  

Seminars cover topics such as how to select the right university, complete application forms, write a statement of purpose, prepare for standardized testing, and get full funding. The Opportunity Funds Program also assists students in financing expenses involved in the university application process, such as paying for an international passport, standardized test fees, visa & SEVIS fees, and a flight ticket to the U.S. 

Although we will work closely with students to try to increase their chances of finding admission and scholarships, please note that the Opportunity Funds Program is NOT a scholarship to study in the U.S.  Rather, we cover the upfront costs of applying to U.S. universities and guide the student to apply to U.S. institutions that can provide full funding. The student's application to the U.S. depends mainly on their application which will be reviewed holistically: SOPs, CV, related experience, GRE scores (which will be funded by us), University transcripts, and degree results. 

The application opens on Friday, April 1st, and closes on Saturday, April 30th, 2022. Please have your qualified contacts apply for the program. They are to complete the online application on www.opportunityfundsnigeria.org and upload all supporting documents there. 

If you have any questions, send me a message via WhatsApp on 08034023263 (text only). Thank you for reading through this email and for helping us identify deserving students.

4/4/22, 8:18 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: 'In this decayed hole among the mountains. 
In the faint moonlight, the grass is singing. 
Over the tumbled graves, about the chapel. 
There is the empty chapel, only the wind's home.

It has no windows, and the door swings,
Dry bones can harm no one.
Only a cock stood on the rooftree.
Co co rico co co rico.
In a flash of lightning. 
Then a damp gust.
Bringing rain.
Ganger was sunken, and the limp leaves
Waited for rain, while the black clouds
Gathered far distant, over Himavant.
The jungle crouched, humped in silence.

Then spoke the thunder'.

(Excerpts from The Wasteland by T.S. Eliot).
Prologue to Doris Lessing's Book

THE GRASS IS SINGING.

4/6/22, 8:31 AM - Obose Eidusi: 1m abi 500k can't remember
4/6/22, 8:39 AM - Ogbole: Ok, I think the parties should have a way of settling other contestants who bought forms and lost out in the primaries
4/6/22, 8:40 AM - Ogbole: Especially when the candidate emerges as the governor after the election
4/6/22, 8:45 AM - Obose Eidusi: Well I don't think dey do
4/6/22, 8:45 AM - Obose Eidusi: It might only happen when consensus is involved . Just maybe
4/6/22, 8:52 AM - Jacob Uguna: So that every man and his dog will buy form knowing that they will be re-imbursed. Bad idea!
4/6/22, 8:53 AM - Obose Eidusi: Yep bad idea
4/6/22, 8:53 AM - Obose Eidusi: Funds collected at this time is what is used to run party affairs

4/6/22, 8:56 AM - Ogbole: and agreement in this regard
4/6/22, 8:56 AM - Obose Eidusi: When d primary is not free and fair that's when d kind of issues arise
4/6/22, 8:58 AM - Jacob Uguna: Because they are party members, and loosing is part of the game. If you don't have 40m you can afford to loose, you should have any business nursing the idea of contesting.
4/6/22, 8:59 AM - Obose Eidusi: üëç
4/6/22, 8:59 AM - Jacob Uguna: Should not*
4/6/22, 9:01 AM - Ogbole: An intelligent response. E clear say u na Prof
4/6/22, 9:03 AM - Obose Eidusi: But it doesn't make sense for a party to refund  money after purchasing a form to contest an election under the platform . Then e mean say anybody wey lose go dey demand their money back ü§£ü§£ü§£
4/6/22, 9:04 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Yup
4/6/22, 9:04 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Makes no sense
4/6/22, 9:04 AM - Ogbole: Please don't forget that personal interest comes before party interest. That's why dey can afford to jump party at any given time

4/6/22, 9:20 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: In the ideal world that never exists in africa
4/6/22, 9:21 AM - Ogbole: Cos Africa is not ideal!!!!!!!
4/6/22, 9:21 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Its a design flaw. Make political positions less economically favourable and you'll start attracting the right people with the right intentions.
4/6/22, 9:22 AM - Ogbole: This lends credence to my earlier stand on the issue
4/6/22, 9:22 AM - Ogbole: Politician wey loose primary want compensation
4/6/22, 9:23 AM - Jacob Uguna: No credence any where
4/6/22, 9:23 AM - Ogbole: To collapse his structure, he wants compensation
4/6/22, 9:23 AM - Jacob Uguna: You should quickly move away from this your compensation talk
4/6/22, 9:23 AM - Jacob Uguna: Where you want make the money come from

4/8/22, 2:41 AM - Chinedu Madu: *How to Respond in Moments of Adversity*
_(Friday 8th April 2022. Read Jeremiah 20:10-13, Psalm 18:2-7, John 10:31-42)_ 

_*‚ÄúThe Jews took up stones again to stone him. Jesus answered them, ‚ÄòI have shown you many good works from the Father; for which of these do you stone me?‚Äô‚Äù (John 10:31-32)*_

To those who picked up stones to throw at Jesus, he said: ‚Äúfor which of my many good works are you stoning me?‚Äù Such is life. The same people who happily flocked around Jesus, witnessed and received several miracles, had their fill of bread and fish, enjoyed Jesus‚Äô life-changing homilies, etc., turned around to stone Jesus. 

It was as though they suddenly forgot all the good Jesus did for them. Those who received the miracles could not read between the lines, they could not see that only God could work such great signs and wonders. They would eventually join in shouting ‚ÄúCrucify Him! Crucify Him!‚Äù for claiming to be God. 

Just as Jesus suffered in the hands of his persecutors, there are moments we find ourselves suffering in the hands of the very persons who have been beneficiaries of our help in times past. The question is, what is the best way to respond under such circumstances? When the same people who fed from you pick up stones against you, what do you do?

Both Jeremiah and Jesus were provoked in our readings today and we have a lot to learn from their reaction. Jeremiah prayed a prayer of surrender. He asks God to fight on his behalf: ‚ÄúO Lord of hosts, who test the righteous, who see the heart and the mind, let me see your vengeance upon them for to you have I committed my cause.‚Äù (Jeremiah 20:12). 

Jeremiah goes on to sing despite the pains in his heart: ‚ÄúSing to the Lord; praise the Lord! For he has delivered the life of the needy from the hand of evildoers.‚Äù (Jeremiah 20:13) The singing of Jeremiah reminds me of Paul and Silas who had the faith to sing praises to God rather than complain while in prison. In moments of adversity, learn to sing praises to God, surrender your adversaries to God, and trust that God can handle the situation perfectly.

Jesus had the power to call down fire to burn down those who were exchanging words with Him but he ‚Äúescaped from their hands and went away across the Jordan.‚Äù Jesus did not use the power he had to fight against his enemies. In moments of adversity, do not resort to the abuse of whatever power you hold. Jesus told us to pray for the conversion rather than the death of our enemies. 

If God allows you to experience such difficult times, know that it is because God knows that something good can come out of it. We learn more in moments of adversity. We discover our true friends and we get to tap into our true inner strength. Adversity toughens and shapes us into God‚Äôs plans for us. Cherish your moment of adversity; know that there can be no crown if there wasn‚Äôt first a cross.

Let us pray: Lord Jesus, in my anguish I call to you, save me lest I perish. Amen.

*Be Happy. Live Positive. Have Faith. It is well with you. (Friday of the 5th week of Lent. Bible Study: Jer. 20:10-13, Ps. 18:2-7, John 10:31-42).*

You know what they all have in common? They all wanted Ole but never wanted Mourinho, LVG or Conte.
Maybe is about time  we realize our ex players are also part of the problem ü§® 
An top it all, Gary Neville an Paul Scholes have proven to be absolute terrible managers. 
‚ô¶Ô∏èNeville has the worst win rate in Valencia history 
‚ô¶Ô∏èScholes ran away after just 31 days at OldHam
So why should we think they know what‚Äôs best possible manager is?

4/9/22, 6:32 AM - Chinedu Madu: *The Fear of the Jews*
_(Saturday 9th April 2022. Read Ezekiel 37:21-28, Jer. 31:10-13, John 11:45-56)_ 

_*‚ÄúWhat are we to do? For this man performs many signs. If we let him go on thus, every one will believe in him, and the Romans will come and destroy both our holy place and our nation.‚Äù (John 11:47-48)*_

The chief priests and the Pharisees with their scribes were thrown into a panic when they heard that many people had come to believe in Jesus. For them, Jesus had to be killed to save their nation.  The particular fear of the Jews was that if Jesus is not killed, He would soon be considered as king by the people and the Romans would be threatened to destroy their nation. 

The fear of the Jews was concretely expressed in John 19:12 ‚ÄúIf you release this man, you are not Caesar's friend; everyone who makes himself a king sets himself against Caesar.‚Äù When Pilate, the Governor heard these words, he realized he had no choice but to consent to the death of Jesus.

Like Herod who killed all the male children born at the time for fear of a rival king, the Chief priests and Pharisees were shaken with fear. Caiaphas speaking prophetically as High Priest noted: ‚ÄúIt is expedient for one man to die than for a whole nation to perish.‚Äù Little did Caiaphas know that he had just summarized the entire mission of Jesus Christ on earth ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Son of man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.‚Äù (Matthew 20:28).

Although the fear of the Jews was baseless, their actions brought about the fulfilment of God‚Äôs divine plan of salvation for mankind. Fear is such a dangerous thing. When we are controlled by fear, like the Jews, we make decisions that we always regret later. The truth is that the real fear of the chief priests and pharisees was that Jesus was a ‚Äúbad market‚Äù for them. Their problem with Jesus was that He was bold enough to tell them the truth; to challenge the establishment. 

Jesus referred to the chief priests and pharisees as hypocrites, white-washed tombs who loved to be greeted obsequiously while praying in the market place meanwhile their hearts were full of iniquity. They hated Jesus because he seemed to have ‚Äúremoved food from their mouth‚Äù when he cleansed the temple which they had practically turned into a business centre. As Jesus continued to gain more and more popularity, they feared that they would soon lose the love and respect of the people; that is, they would soon become powerless.

Child of God, let us examine our conscience: Do I feel threatened by anyone who is doing well in life? In all sincerity, are there certain persons I secretly envy and pray for their downfall because they have become successful or are now far ahead of me? Do I kill through character assassination ‚Äì bearing false tales about others just to bring them down? Perhaps, I am guilty of the fear of the Jews. Repent. Let others shine. Celebrate the greatness in each person. Be humble enough to accept the truth.  

Let us pray: Lord Jesus, teach me to love others as you love me. Amen.

*Be Happy. Live Positive. Have Faith. It is well with you. (Saturday of the 5th week of Lent. Bible Study: Ezekiel 37:21-28, Jer. 31:10-13, John 11:45-56).*

A den of thieves in the state of Bihar in India decided to go for the ultimate jackpot, though it was not money or gold. The group allegedly pretended to be government irrigation officials and proceed to steal a 60-foot abandoned steel bridge, according to NDTV. They allegedly used gas cutters and transport machines to demolish the bridge and steal its scrap metal, all in broad daylight. ‚ÄúSince such construction and repair tasks happen at a slow pace, the department would have generated a notice to inform us prior,‚Äù one actual irrigation engineer quoted another one as saying. Local officials have launched a police inquiry into the heist, which shocked Bihar‚Äôs Rohtas district. The 12-foot-tall bridge (seen in tweets here) lasted for a lengthy period, however; it was built in 1972 over the Ara canal.

WHY I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, BY OSINBAJO 

*My experiences, insights, opportunities must be used for Nigeria and Nigerians, VP adds



In the past seven years, I have served as Vice President under a true Nigerian patriot, a servant of the nation in war and peace, and a man of integrity, President Muhammadu Buhari. 

We have, together, worked through some of the most difficult times in the history of our Nation, but we have remained focused on securing the country, providing infrastructure and growing our economy. 

As stipulated by the Nigerian Constitution, our tenure will end next year.

In this period of seven years, I have served the government in several capacities, and have, at the direction of Mr. President, represented our country in sensitive high level international engagements. I have been to practically all local governments in Nigeria. I have been in markets, factories, schools, and farms. I have been in agricultural, mining and oil producing communities; in the Delta, in Kebbi, Enugu, Borno; Rivers, Plateau and Ondo; & in all other States of the federation, listening to the diverse experiences and yearnings of our people.

I have visited our gallant troops in the North East and our brothers and sisters in the IDP camps. I have felt the pain and anguish of victims in violent conflicts, terrorist attacks, flooding, fire and other disasters. 

I have been in the homes of many ordinary Nigerians in various parts of the country. I have sat with our techprenuers in Lagos, Edo, and Kaduna, with our Nollywood and Kannywood actors; with our musicians, from Lagos, Onitsha, and Kano. And I have spoken to small and large businesses.

I stood where they stood and sat where they sat. I know their hopes, aspirations and fears; and I believe that in those hopes and aspirations are the seeds for the great Nigeria that we all desire.

I believe that the very reason why the Almighty God gave me these experiences, these insights, and these opportunities, is that they must be put to the use of our country and it‚Äôs great peoples.

Which is why I am today, with utmost humility, formally declaring my intention to run for the Office of the President, Federal Republic of Nigeria, on the platform of our great party, the All Progressives Congress.
If by the grace of God and the will of the people, I am given the opportunity, then I believe that first, we must complete what we have started;

*radically transforming our security and intelligence architecture,

*completing the reform of our justice system focusing on adequate remuneration and welfare of judicial personnel,

*ensuring justice for all and the observance of rule of law,

*rapidly advancing our infrastructure development, especially power, roads, railways and broadband connectivity,

*providing an excellent environment for businesses to thrive,

*taking the agriculture revolution to the next level especially mechanization and developing the farm to table value chain

*making sure that the government, its agencies and regulators serve the business community,

*creating a tech economy that will provide jobs for millions;

 *enhancing our Social Investment Programme to a full scale social welfare scheme,

*completing the promise of lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty within this decade,
*completing the task of ensuring that all Nigerians, male and female, attend school,

*reforming our educational system for relevance to the challenges of this century,

*completing the task of universal health coverage for all, 

and

*strengthening the capacity of States and Local Governments to deliver on their respective mandates.

Above all, front and centre of our efforts will be the provision of jobs and opportunities for our young people.

I now most solemnly and respectfully seek the support of fellow Nigerians everywhere in this land, and the diaspora, young and old, male and female, in the great and exciting journey that we have ahead of us.

We will, working together, establish by the grace of God, the Nigeria of our dreams in a few short years. We will build on the foundation laid by our predecessors. We will need to move, with much speed, intentionality, and perseverance, towards the vision of a prosperous, stable, and secure nation.

I am convinced beyond doubt that we have the creativity, the courage, the talent, and the resources to be the foremost black nation on earth. Let us now birth the expectations of greatness conceived generations before us.

Let us build a Nigeria where the man from Nnewi sees the man in Gusau as his brother, where the woman in Warri sees the woman in Jalingo as her sister, where the love of our nation burns alike in the hearts of boys and girls
from Gboko to Yenogoa. Where everywhere, in this land, is home for everyone, where our diversities, tribes and faiths unite, rather than divide us.

Let our tribes become one tribe; the Nigerian tribe, where all are treated fairly, justly and with respect. Where all are given equal access to the abundant opportunities that God has bestowed on this nation. It's time.

God bless and keep our Republic and its great people.

Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, SAN
Vice President, Federal Republic of Nigeria

Atiku challenged that former president Goodluck Jonathan was President for 6 years. For fairness and equity, he should not contest but he is contesting.

Olusegun Obasanjo was President for 8 years. For fairness and equity, Fayose should not contest but he is contesting.

My region (North East) has not produced a president in this country but I am ready to step down if PDP zones it to South East.

‚ÄúIf Wike and Fayose want fairness and equity, they should be fighting for PDP presidential ticket to be zoned to the South-East and not South‚Äù ‚Äì Atiku Abubakar declared

4/12/22, 1:00 PM - Osa Eweka: I'VE NOT ENDORSED TINUBU -
DELE MOMODU

In all honesty, I do not know who the media handlers of ASIWAJU BOLA AHMED TINUBU are but I can reasonably confirm that they've been fumbling too much by being so cheap, unimaginative and jejune in their campaigns. Are they not ashamed that several people, including the respected DR AKINWUMI ADESINA of the African Development Bank, have publicly denied endorsing TINUBU for the 2023 Presidential election because of this unfortunate desperation to sell him as the only candidate of APC in 2023. 
Now, I'm their latest victim. An article I wrote two years ago about TINUBU has suddenly become a fresh endorsement in 2022. What chicanery is this? While I have tremendous respect for ASIWAJU BOLA AHMED TINUBU, his handlers have no right to engage in pure mischief by abusing our relationship. They've even made pamphlets of my article. But unknown to them, a lot of water has passed under the bridge since I wrote that article and I have my cogent reasons for not joining APC - PRESIDENT MUHAMMADU BUHARI's divisiveness and the culpable silence of TINUBU and the Vice President PROFESSOR YEMI OSINBAJO in condoning his excesses and keeping mute in the face of barefaced tyranny. Southern Leaders who crave to be President have failed to protect their own people from the blistering attacks they've endured under the Buhari government, most especially the people of the South East. The whole country is in turmoil and Northern Leaders have been more courageous in telling Buhari the blatant truth while ours have been so cowardly because of their insatiable propensity for power...
I have other reasons... 
I earnestly ask the spin doctors to delete my name from their reckless and self seeking endorsements...

4/13/22, 2:14 AM - Chinedu Madu: *And They Paid Him Thirty Pieces of Silver*
_(Wednesday 13th April 2022. Read Isaiah 50:4-9, Ps. 69:8-10,21-22,31,33-34, Matthew 26:14-25)_ 

_*‚ÄúWhen Jesus had thus spoken, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, ‚ÄòTruly, truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me.‚Äô The disciples looked at one another...‚Äù (John 13:21-22)*_

To prove to Naaman that it was God who cured him, Elisha refused to accept gifts from Naaman. Gehazi, Elisha‚Äôs servant could not resist the gifts that Elisha rejected. He ran after Naaman and told a lie: My master has sent me to say, ‚ÄúThere have just now come to me from the hill country of Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets; pray, give them a talent of silver and two festal garments.‚Äù As a result of telling lies in the name of the prophet, Gehazi became leprous.

Judas knew the Jews were planning to kill Jesus and he also knew that they lacked certain insider information about Jesus. Like Gehazi, Judas pounced on this opportunity to make some money for himself. He went to the Jews saying: ‚ÄúWhat would you give me if I deliver him to you?‚Äù If Judas had not gone to the Jews, they would have on their own found a way to arrest Jesus. Judas only made it easy for them. 

Jesus said: ‚ÄúThe Son of man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.‚Äù (Matthew 26:24). I can only imagine the pain Jesus felt in our Gospel passage knowing that someone who shared the same plate with him was going to betray him. This is the pain Jesus feels when we turn God‚Äôs house into a money-making enterprise when we tell lies by pronouncing fake prophecies just to gain popularity and wealth.

Just as Isaiah sings in today‚Äôs first reading, Jesus is silent, he turns not backward, He gives His back to those who strike Him and His cheeks to those who pulled out the beard. He does not hide His face from shame and spitting. And as St. Paul said to the Philippians, ‚Äúbeing found in human form He humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even death on a cross. Therefore, God has highly exalted Him and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name.‚Äù (Philippians 2:8-9)

Let us pray: Lord Jesus, free me from greed that I may truly worship You. Amen.

*Be Happy. Live Positive. Have Faith. It is well with you. (Wednesday of Holy Week. Bible Study: Isaiah 50:4-9, Ps. 69:8-10,21-22,31,33-34, Matthew 26:14-25).*

4/22/22, 2:59 AM - Chinedu Madu: *You Have Risen with Christ: Totally Depend on Jesus*
_(Friday 22nd April 2022. Read Acts 4:1-12, Ps. 118:1-2,4,22-27, John 21:1-14)_ 

_*‚ÄúSimon Peter said to them, ‚ÄúI am going fishing.‚Äù They said to him, ‚ÄúWe will go with you.‚Äù They went out and got into the boat; but that night they caught nothing.‚Äù (John 21:3)*_

Can we disobey the will of God for our lives and still be successful? Or can we possibly ignore God‚Äôs words, disregard his commandments and still hope to achieve our dreams and aspirations in life? Peter was already a successful fisherman when Jesus called him. Even though Peter did not receive any training to be a Rabbi, Jesus saw in him qualities capable of heading the Church.  

One night, Peter and his fellow fishermen worked all through and caught nothing. The following morning, Jesus used his boat to preach. Afterward, Jesus asked Peter to put out a little from the shore and Peter protested: ‚ÄúMaster, we worked all night and caught nothing‚Ä¶‚Äù (Luke 5:5). Eventually, they netted such a huge catch that they had to call other fishermen to help them. Peter said to Jesus: ‚ÄúGo away from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man!‚Äù (Luke 5:8).

In today‚Äôs Gospel passage, Peter despite his three-year walk with Jesus, said to his fellow disciples: ‚ÄúI am going fishing.‚Äù Given Peter was their leader, the other disciples followed. The same thing that happened in Luke chapter 5 happened again in John 21. They toiled all night and caught nothing. The following morning, Jesus was standing by the shore and he told them to cast their nets right there and behold a great catch; one hundred and fifty-three big fishes all at once!

Sometimes, it is good for us to experience failure so that we may have the opportunity of asking ourselves certain very serious questions. ‚ÄúAm I just trying to make money or am I doing what God brought me to this life to do?‚Äù This experience had another profound effect on Peter. It made him realize that the God who called him was the creator and director of everything in this world. It made Peter totally fearless knowing that with God on his side, no human being can threaten him. 

It is this fearlessness that we see in Peter in today‚Äôs first reading. Consider the boldness with which he spoke to the Chief priests and leaders of the Jews: ‚ÄúLet it be known to all of you, and to all the people of Israel, that this man is standing before you in good health by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead. This Jesus is the stone that was rejected by you, the builders; it has become the cornerstone.‚Äù (Acts 4:10-11).  

Let us pray: Lord Jesus, I place my trust in you. May I never take any decision in life without first consulting you. Amen.

*Be Happy. Live Positive. Have Faith. It is well with you. (Easter Friday. Bible Study: Acts 4:1-12, Ps. 118:1-2,4,22-27, John 21:1-14)*

4/23/22, 2:52 AM - Chinedu Madu: *Fear No Man, Only Obey God.*
_(Saturday 23rd April 2022. Read Acts 4:13-21, Ps. 118:1,14-21, Mark 16:9-15)_ 

_*‚ÄúNow when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were uneducated, common men, they wondered; and they recognized that they had been with Jesus. But seeing the man that had been healed standing beside them, they had nothing to say in opposition.‚Äù (Acts 4:13-14)*_

The greatest obstacle to growth in spiritual life is fear; fear of people, fear of authority, and fear of enemies. Ironically, the only reason we fear people is that we do not fear God. We are frightened at what people can do because we take God for granted! The Bible says: ‚ÄúThe Fear of God is the beginning of Wisdom.‚Äù (Job 28:28, Psalm 111:10, Proverbs 1:7 & Proverbs 9:10) Each time we disobey God for fear of what our fellow human beings can do to us, we act foolishly; we behave as if God is not capable of fighting for us. 

Think about the times you had to consent to evil because you felt threatened by a fellow human being. Think about the times you gave in to sin because you just wanted to blend with peers or because you wanted to be accepted and praised by others. When the authorities told Peter and John never to speak again in the name of Jesus, they asked a very important question: ‚ÄúWhether it is right in God's sight to listen to you rather than to God, you must judge; for we cannot keep from speaking about what we have seen and heard.‚Äù (Acts 4:19-20). 

Peter and the other disciples had already received a mandate from the Risen Jesus to go to the ends of the earth to preach as we read in our Gospel passage today. This was why they could say: ‚ÄúWe cannot keep from speaking about what we have seen and heard.‚Äù It is my prayer for you that you will reach a point in your walk with Christ when you are no longer afraid of people; a point where you are prepared to face the furnace, like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego or like Peter and John who were bold enough to accuse the religious leaders of killing Jesus.

Christianity today is under serious attack, this time not from strangers to the faith but from fully professed Christians who are wolves in sheep‚Äôs clothing. They make Christianity look like a scam and give the worst possible representation of Christ. Social media is agog daily with all the recklessness and crimes committed in the name of ‚ÄúChurch.‚Äù 

As much as we continue to de-market these fraudsters, let us not forget that the real weapon against darkness is light. We must start letting our light shine by showing good examples. We must preach (as Jesus says in today‚Äôs Gospel passage) not just with words but with good deeds. The only hope left for Christianity in Africa today is the witness of God-fearing Christians living righteous lives. 

Let us pray: Lord Jesus, help me to overcome my fear of human beings. Give me the wisdom to totally resign myself to you as I work to advance your kingdom on earth. Amen.

*Be Happy. Live Positive. Have Faith. It is well with you. (Easter Saturday. Bible Study: Acts 4:13-21, Ps. 118:1,14-21, Mark 16:9-15)*

4/24/22, 5:04 AM - Chinedu Madu: *Peace, Forgiveness, Healing, and Revelation: Expressions of Divine Mercy.*
_(Sunday 24th April 2022. Read Acts 5:12-16, Ps. 118:2-4,22-27, Rev. 1:9-13,17-19, John 20:19-31)_ 

_*‚ÄúJesus said to them again, ‚ÄòPeace be with you. As the Father has sent me, even so I send you.‚Äô And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, ‚ÄòReceive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.‚Äù (John 20:21-23)*_

Today is called Divine Mercy Sunday. This is because, on this day, exactly one week after Jesus Christ rose from the dead, He displayed the magnanimity of His Divine Mercy not just to the disciples but to the whole world. Today, we shall be looking at the meaning of Divine mercy by exploring its various dimensions as presented in our readings for today.

*1. Divine Mercy is expressed in Peace.*
John tells us that the disciples were locked up in a room for fear of the Jews. Even though they were told that Jesus had risen from the dead, they were still afraid because they did not believe. In Mark‚Äôs gospel, we are told that Jesus ‚Äúupbraided them for their unbelief and hardness of heart.‚Äù (Mark 16:14). When we are afraid of people, it is a sign that we do not trust God. The disciples shut the door against themselves hoping that the wooden bars and locks would keep them safe forgetting that in the event of an attack, these would have easily been broken. 

Fear is often the result of panic. The disciples were afraid because they were still trying to fully comprehend what had just happened; they had not yet recovered from the utter shock of seeing Jesus treated like a criminal and crucified. At the bottom of their fear was a lack of inner peace. Jesus did not knock on the door but entered into their midst first, to show them the futility of trusting in human devices for protection, and secondly, to show them Divine mercy by calming their minds. 

Hence, the first thing Jesus says to them is: ‚ÄúPeace be with you.‚Äù When there is peace in our hearts, it is only then we can see the hand of God clearly working in our lives despite our external situation. Without peace, our minds are not at rest, we suddenly forget what God can do and we begin to run helter-skelter. We act without reason and without faith like the disciples did when they faced a storm at sea while Jesus slept peacefully in the cushion. Child of God, each time you feel restless deep within you or you cannot understand what is going on around you, learn to say this short prayer: ‚ÄúJesus, I trust in you.‚Äù Keep saying it until you become calm, then your eyes will be open to see Jesus right there with you.

*2. Divine Mercy is expressed in God‚Äôs Forgiveness.*
Immediately after calming the minds of the disciples, Jesus proceeded to create the sacrament of forgiveness. Not only was Jesus absolving the disciples themselves of their faults, He made them ministers of God‚Äôs forgiveness by empowering them with the ability to either forgive or retain the sins of others. This again is another concrete expression of Divine Mercy. If you have ever gone attended the sacrament of penance with the faith that you are not just talking to your fellow human being but one to whom God has given the power to forgive sins, you will discover how light you feel afterward. 

When we go for confession, God so forgives our sins and washes us that we can confidently say we become new creatures. God does not remember our sins because the moment we offload them at the confessional, our old self dies and we leave as newborn babies. Just as you cannot accuse a newborn baby of sin, God no longer accuses us of the sins that we have dropped at the confessional. Never be too shy to go to confession; it is not the priest who forgives us but Jesus Christ himself who gave the priest the power to retain or absolve sins in His name.

Jesus again concretely expressed Divine Mercy by forgiving Thomas who demanded evidence to prove that Jesus was truly alive. After making Thomas touch His hands and feet and feel his side that was pierced with a lance, Jesus said: ‚ÄúBlessed are those who have not seen and yet believe.‚Äù (John 20:29) I think this statement perfectly applies to all those Christians who are never tired of asking questions like: ‚Äúwhere is so and so in the bible? Show me, where is it written?‚Äù 

Thomas was told that Jesus came but he was asking, ‚Äúwhere is it in the bible?‚Äù He was asking for evidence. Jesus says to us today: ‚ÄúBlessed are those who have not seen where it is stated in the Bible and yet believe.‚Äù If you decide to limit your faith only to what you see in the bible, I wonder if you really have faith at all. I wonder how you can believe that a God for whom nothing is impossible would confine Himself to the bible alone. Even the Bible itself expresses its limitation by saying it is not everything Jesus did that is written down. (John 20:31 & John 21:25). 

*3. Divine Mercy is expressed in Healing.*
In today‚Äôs first reading, we see how God worked great signs and wonders through the ministry of the apostles. It got to an extent that they carried out the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and pallets, that as Peter came by at least his shadow might fall on some of them. The final verse of today‚Äôs first reading states: ‚ÄúThe people also gathered from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing the sick and those afflicted with unclean spirits, and they were all healed.‚Äù (Acts 5:16). Take note, it says: ‚Äúthey were all healed‚Äù meaning no one was left out.

Being a priest myself, I must confess that each time I read this passage, I ask myself: ‚ÄúHow come God is not using me like He used Peter and the other disciples? Is it not the same anointing that is flowing in me? If only the shadow of Peter could cure the sick, why is it that I have laid my hands on the sick only to hear that they later died?‚Äù As I ponder on these questions, I also cannot but mention that there are countless times that I prayed for people and they came back with testimonies. 

There was even a day I said something to someone jokingly at it became a prophecy ‚Äì yes, it happened exactly as I said to the extent that I became afraid of my mouth. He was thanking me but deep inside of me, I knew this was not my doing at all. There was a time that someone asked me to pray for them, I wrote it down hoping to go with the intention to mass but before I got to the church, the person called again to say God has done it. In each of these instances, I had to make it very clear that it is not me but God at work.

Now get the point: Miracles are still happening today. God is still very much at work in the affairs of mankind. Just as the Bible does not contain everything we need to know about God, miracles and inspiration did not stop with the Bible. However, when God is working, it is never for the glorification of the minister but for God‚Äôs own glory. Let us avoid worshipping the minister. Every miraculous healing is God showing His Divine Mercy, not God telling us that so and so is powerful. Be careful, there are a lot of scammers out there. Shine your eyes.

*4. Divine mercy is expressed in Revelation.*
In today‚Äôs second reading, John describes his experience, or rather, his encounter with God on the island of Patmos. He tells us that he found himself there on account of the tribulation and persecution that the Christian community was facing. In fact, if we want to understand the book of Revelation, we must bear in mind that this whole book was addressed to the Christians who were suffering the heat of severe persecution. This is why John employs very coded languages to pass on his message. John‚Äôs purpose was to give consolation to the Christians and assure them of a better life ahead. 

One of the ways God shows mercy to us is by revealing certain things to us that we would never have been able to figure out on our own. The truth is that the more we draw close to God, the more we would hear God speaking to us. As God spoke to John on the island of Patmos, God speaks to us in moments we are afraid, depressed, confused, and troubled. Instead of running helter-skelter looking for quick fixes for our problems, let us develop the act of listening to God. Spend time each day to meditate on God‚Äôs word and your life would never be the same again.
   
Let us pray: Lord Jesus, open my eyes to see your mercy at work every day of my life. Amen.

*Be Happy. Live Positive. Have Faith. It is well with you. (Divine Mercy Sunday. Bible Study: Acts 5:12-16, Ps. 118:2-4,22-27, Rev. 1:9-13,17-19, John 20:19-31)*

4/25/22, 3:16 AM - +234 803 340 0059: The entire Nigeria administrative system has been eroded with corruption on a massive scale. Can this be fixed? Yes! U just need over  10 dozen of high profile scapegoats from both northern and southern extract. Execute some, Jail some, sack some! Oil and light subsidy can be removed, oil theft can be curbed. 

Where there is problem is sourcing money for provision of necessary economic infrastructure such as electricity generation/ distribution, roads, etc. 

The country is far gone, but it's not a fatal case, Oga. We just need the right person at the helm of affairs. One who isn't afraid to go against these men. Cos truth is, they all know people doing these things; those propagating oil theft, the insecurity, the administrative fraud, etc. it's just till tomorrow, nobody is doing anything about it. 

This is not to say if the opportunity arises I nor go ball out; who no like better thing.

4/26/22, 2:08 AM - Chinedu Madu: *To be Born Anew is to Repent from Selfishness*
_(Tuesday 26th April 2022. Read Acts 4:32-37, Ps. 93:1-2,5, John 3:7-15)_ 

_*‚ÄúNow the company of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one said that any of the things which he possessed was his own, but they had everything in common.‚Äù (Acts 4:32)*_

Whenever a new group, society, or organization emerges, there are certain unique traits used in identifying them. Long before believers were called Christians, one of their most distinguishing features was oneness. No one said any of the things he possessed was his own. Unlike many Christian communities today, the first group of believers were not self-centered, they looked out for each other, they were generous, there weren‚Äôt competitions or rivalries over material riches among them.

In his conversation with Nicodemus, Jesus made a statement that describes the extent of his generosity: ‚ÄúAs Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of man be lifted up, that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.‚Äù (John 3:15). Jesus did not die only for the Jews, neither did he die only for the twelve, not even for his country only, Jesus died for the whole of humanity.

If we lack this spirit of oneness amongst us, can we really say we are Christ-like? If there are divisions and rivalries in our midst, can we say we are followers of Christ who sacrificed everything to ensure our salvation? If our churches today are stack opposites of the first community of believers, it is because we have made money into a god. In many ways, worship of God has been reduced to a quest for material riches and as a result of this, human sympathy, love for neighbour, and concern for the less privileged have disappeared from our hearts.

Recently, I saw a quote that made me reflect seriously on life. It states: ‚ÄúWe come into this world with nothing. We then fight to get everything only to leave everything again behind and return with nothing.‚Äù Instead of complaining about not having this or that, instead of saying you don‚Äôt have as much as you desire, why not open your eyes to the even worse conditions of many around you? Why not remind yourself that soon enough, you would have to relinquish everything you are working and praying hard now to get. 

Our greatest instinct is self-preservation; we would rather kill others to survive than offer ourselves to be sacrificed for the good of others. No wonder, Jesus Christ is inviting us to a second birth; to a new life; a life that looks out for the good of others; a life free from selfishness.

Let us pray: Lord Jesus, make me realize that my true security lies in being kind to others. Amen. 

*Be Happy. Live Positive. Have Faith. It is well with you. (Tuesday of the 2nd week of Eastertide. Bible Study: Acts 4:32-37, Ps. 93:1-2,5, John 3:7-15)*

Real Madrid have rejected Paul Pogba üö®

Big news coming from Real Madrid camp, the club has rejected the offer to sign Paul Pogba on a free transfer next season. Mino Raiola offered the Frenchman to the Spanish giants last week and Florentino Perez this morning has rejected the offer. Simone Alvarez, the Real Madrid insider has said the club is looking for young midfielders like Tchouam√©ni and Declan Rice, they will not sign a 29 year old midfielder in Paul Pogba for anything above ‚Ç¨200k/week. Moreover they already have Modric, Casemiro and Kroos as their preferred first team midfielders, and they will only invest big money for young talent. 

Paul Pogba to Real Madrid if Off üö´

4/27/22, 2:43 AM - Chinedu Madu: *The Lowly One Called and the Lord Heard*
_(Wednesday 27th April 2022. Read Acts 5:17-26, Ps. 34:2-9, John 3:16-21)_ 

_*‚ÄúBut at night an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and brought them out and said: 'Go and stand in the temple and speak to the people all the words of this Life.‚Äô‚Äù (Acts 5:19-20)*_

Our first reading today continues the story of the earliest Christian community. As more persons were added to their number, the high priest and his companions were so filled with jealousy that they laid hands on the apostles and put them in the public jail. When we let our light shine, we are bound to face persecution, and sometimes, this persecution comes from the house of God.

Jesus tells Nicodemus in today‚Äôs Gospel passage that our world is filled with people who prefer darkness to light. ‚ÄúAnd this is the verdict, that the light came into the world, but people preferred darkness to light because their works were evil. For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come toward the light.‚Äù (John 3:19-20). We live in a world that celebrates evil, immorality, and corruption; a world that prefers Barabbas to Jesus; a world where you would have enemies even for attempting to live a righteous life.

Are we then to stop letting our light shine because of the powerful forces of darkness who try to stop us? Not at all. The battle belongs to the Lord. God surely knows how to fight for his children. That night, God sent an angel to rescue the apostles. The angel opened the prison doors and led them out saying: ‚ÄúGo and take your place in the temple area, and tell the people everything about this life.‚Äù The apostles went to the temple area proclaiming this great miracle that had just happened. 

Our responsorial psalm today says: ‚ÄúThe Angel of the Lord is encamped around those who fear Him, to rescue them. Taste and see that the Lord is Good. Blessed is the man who seeks refuge in him.‚Äù (Psalm 93). If we are faithful to God, He will never abandon or forsake us. Since no one can fight God and succeed, know that if God is on your side, no one can fight you and succeed.

God did not prevent the apostles from being arrested but He rescued them from prison. Sometimes, it may look as though our enemies are succeeding but God always has a plan. Be patient. By freeing the apostles from prison, God made it clear to the high priest and his companions that nothing, not even the prison chains can stop the message of salvation from reaching the ends of the earth. 

The entire Sanhedrin gathered the next day to try the matter. They sent for the apostles ‚Äúbut the court officers who went did not find them in the prison, so they came back and reported, ‚ÄòWe found the jail securely locked and the guards stationed outside the doors, but when we opened them, we found no one inside.‚Äô‚Ä¶ Then someone came in and reported to them, ‚ÄòThe men whom you put in prison are in the temple area and are teaching the people.‚Äô‚Äù (Acts 5:22-23).

Regardless of what you are going through right now, surrender yourself to God in prayer. Do not compromise to evil for fear of what people can do to you. You are like a sheep in the midst of wolves but never forget that God is a shepherd who knows how best to take care of His children. Call on God and He will not abandon or forsake you.

Let us pray: Lord Jesus, deepen my trust in your protection that I may fearlessly walk in your light. Amen.

*Be Happy. Live Positive. Have Faith. It is well with you. (Wednesday of the 2nd week of Eastertide. Bible Study: Acts 5:17-26, Ps. 34:2-9, John 3:16-21)*

I am a medical doctor while my husband is a software developer. 

We both had good jobs until my husband lost his job and getting another well paid job became difficult, we both decided that I should travel to Canada for a job I got around that time and when I am stabilised, he would join me with the children. We are blessed with 2girls. 

We continued with our lives. 

December 2018, I decided to come to NIGERIA for the festivities and to celebrate or 20th wedding anniversary. 

When I arrived, I noticed a tensed atmosphere between my daughters and their father. I thought it was the teenager ‚Äì parent‚Äôs issue, so I ignored it. 

But when I noticed that my daughters would sometimes be rude to their father, I demanded to know what was going on. 

This became a matter of concern because, my daughters used to adore their father.  

I tried several times to get my daughters to speak with me but all they had to say was for me to talk to my husband. 

I had to ask my husband what was going on. He told me it was nothing he could not handle and that our daughters were keeping bad company in school and because of this, he decided to disallow them from going out and attending parties. 

He drops them in school and created time to pick them from school.

I was happy as such strong hand is needed for teenage girls. I then ignored their attitude. 

Few days to when I was to travel back to Canada. I called my daughters to speak with them. 

After a long talk, they told me that daddy did not want them to go out because he was having sex with both of them. 

When my husband came back from the office, I confronted him and they repeated what they told me in his presence. 

My husband denied vehemently but the girls insisted that it was happening. 

I was confused and I sought the counsel of our pastor and his parents. 

They called our daughters and they said the same thing. 

I didn‚Äôt know who to believe. My husband kept begging me to believe him but I just was not ready to listen because I could not see reason why our children would lie about such. 

I made arrangement and took my children back to Canada with me despite the loans I had to take, for the extra costs. 

While I filed for divorce. I raised my children alone for about 3years. 

Then I heard the news that my now ex husband was getting married to someone else. 

I mentioned it to the girls and expressed how sad I was that a man that would do that to his daughters went scotfree because there is no evidence to push a case. 

I bursted out crying while apologizing to my girls about what he put them through. 

It was there that they confessed that their father did not touch them. 

That they lied because their father did not give them the freedom to do what they wanted and they wanted to leave NIGERIA. 

My world shattered. where do I start from? How do I beg my husband? What do I say? 

Probably, I should have trusted my husband, but I was just trying to be a good mother. 

I lost a good man. How do I get him to forgive his children and I ? Can I still save my home ?

4/29/22, 8:08 AM - Chinedu Madu: *No One Can Fight God*
_(Friday 29th April 2022. Read Acts 5:34-42, Ps. 27:1,4,13-14, John 6:1-15)_ 

_*‚ÄúSo in the present case I tell you, keep away from these men and let them alone; for if this plan or this undertaking is of men, it will fail; but if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them.‚Äù (Acts 5:38-39)*_

‚ÄúIf this plan or this undertaking of men, it will fail; but if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them. In very simple terms, Gamaliel was saying: ‚ÄúNo one can fight God and win.‚Äù This statement brought an end to the persecution of the early Christians by the Jewish authorities. They must have said to themselves: ‚ÄúLet us watch and see what would become of these illiterate, uneducated, retired fishermen going about preaching about Jesus Christ.‚Äù 

Two thousand years later, the Church is still standing. What other evidence do we need to show that this undertaking is of God? As Jesus puts it: ‚ÄúYou are Peter, and on this rock, I will build my church, and the powers of death shall not prevail against it.‚Äù (Matthew 16:18).

In our Gospel passage today, we read about the feeding of the multitude by Jesus. Firstly, it is interesting to note that none of the people asked for food but Jesus knew they were hungry and worked a miracle to feed them. Very often, we complain about our unanswered prayers forgetting that most of the time, God provides for us without us even asking.

Secondly, the feeding of the multitude teaches us the miraculous power of charity. Every time they broke the bread to share with someone else, it literally multiplied. In the end, from five loaves, they had twelve baskets full of left-overs. As Anne Frank once said: ‚ÄúNo one ever became poor by giving.‚Äù

Thirdly this miracle displays the power of God over the works of nature and everything contained in this world. As Gamaliel noted, any undertaking that is entirely human is bound to fail but when God is involved, no one can bring it down. How often and how willing am I to involve God in my daily choices and actions? 

Fourthly, we learn that Jesus did not come to seek earthly power and glory but to lead us to our true home; heaven. After the miracle, Jesus withdrew from the crowd perceiving that they were about to declare him King. The multitude had not seen anything like this before and they felt (in a materialistic sense) that Jesus was the answer to all they needed. 

The mistake of the multitude is still being made by many of us Christians today. We somehow forget that our true home is in heaven and that no matter how good we desire life to be, we are forever strangers (pilgrims, passers-by) on earth. Let us tell ourselves the truth. Our churches in Africa are packed full not because we are converted Christians but because of the prevailing economic situation of our continent. These souls who ate the loaves and fishes were not believers but spectators. 

A good number of those who fill up seats in our churches today are just spectators. This explains the stark contradiction between our lives and that of Christ. Should it happen that our continent becomes better economically, this mammoth crowd of spectators will leave and only true Christians will remain. Proof of this is the statistic of Africans who were extremely religious while in Africa only to abandon religion completely once they travelled abroad and found greener pastures. Just the crowd wanted to make Jesus king, men of God today are not just kings but semi-deities in our society. No one can curtail their excesses because even our political leaders are afraid of them.
 
Let us pray: Lord Jesus, deepen my confidence in you. Amen.

*Be Happy. Live Positive. Have Faith. It is well with you. (Saint Catherine of Siena, Virgin, Doctor. Bible Study: Acts 5:34-42, Ps. 27:1,4,13-14, John 6:1-15)*

4/30/22, 6:47 AM - Sylvanus Oseghale: Peter Obi's $20 million investment on behalf of Anambra State in Sabmiller Group is now worth $100 million, according to Soludo, and Anambra State now the  largest individual shareholder  in the global corporation. At the time of investment, the state was ranked 15th.

In Okonjo Iweala's book, 'Fighting Corruption Is Dangerous: The Story Behind the Headlines', she wrote of Peter Obi as the only governor who supported the move by Goodluck Jonathan when Crude oil hit an all time high between 2011 and 2014, to remit proceeds from the sale to the excess crude account.

Other Governors revolted and wanted it shared. When they got theirs, some stashed the money in different accounts, some used it to sponsor elections and others wasted in on many different frivolities.

Never Obi. He quickly invested the entire proceeds in Eurobond, Sabmiller (an international brewery), and many other foreign companies. 

Today Anambra State earns from the investment in Eurobond when many state runs to Eurobond to take loans.

the initial $20m investment in Sabmiller is worth over $100m making Anambra the largest shareholder of the company worldwide. 

Obi has always been clear of all these rogue politicians who just want to squander money with no futuristic plans.

5/1/22, 11:10 AM - Brume Ikogho: Happy Sunday y'all! Did you go to church? üòú

Uncle Ben Ponders: on gods and items of worship 

And your actual god is........ 

It's a Sunday and if you are from my neck of the woods, you'll have a timeline surged with religious posts - people showing off their dressing or makeup or so.... With the line "let's praise the Lord"..... Or You'll see tons of Bible quotes or lyrics from sacred songs.... 

I have nothing against it! 

But who do you actually worship? Who do you actually depend on? What do you actually believe? 

If one bows to a hand crafted ikenga daily, would that be his god? If one supplicated to a religious leader (or a famous person) daily, would that be his god? Is the concept of god evolving with technology? Or have idols just changed form? Doesn't God read whatsapp chats? Perhaps God even has a whatsapp group and shares silly memes & jokes too? 

Just a few questions - ponder,  don't answer! Just ponder..... 

1/ what do you read more - your bible or Facebook (instagram, LinkedIn, whatsapp etc) posts? And which do you happily repost? 

2/ what is your first activity when you wake up  - say a prayer or touch your mobile phone? 

3/ what is your last activity before you sleep? Does it also have much to do with your phone? 

4/ where does your strength come from - your self affirmations or what people say or what your pastor says or your own interpretation of worth based on meditation? 

5/ who do you trust more - your Bible or Google? 

6/ have you missed church because you didn't have the right thing to wear or it wasn't ironed  or didn't fit? If church is "home" why do you need to dress up? What would happen if you went to church dressed casually and not "photo-ready" 

7/ are you one of those that think that adding a "God line" to your post makes you "right with God"...... Eg, you know you are showing off your new car or dressing or whatever and then think that by adding "God has been good to me" or "it's been God all the way" etc, your post becomes right? 

And in all these, do you even feel like you are doing anything wrong? Is it even wrong in the first place? 

Who is fooling who? 

How would you feel when you realise that your object of reverence,  trust and worship might have moved?

This time that parties are organizing their primaries, Okowa wants to use our money to run PDP primaries, not for the development of the state. Okowa has not published what he has received so far from the federal government.

‚ÄúIGR has never been accounted for. 13 percent derivation has not been accounted for. That is to show that Okowa‚Äôs government is worse than any other government that has been before he came on board. That money must not be released from any bank to the state.

5/3/22, 3:16 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Adebayo is only holding this view because the old guards of yorubaland don't want Tinubu to become president. They know that their fading relevance will be obliterated once and for all if the Jagaban becomes president!

5/3/22, 5:46 AM - Chinedu Madu: *Yes, You Too Can Be A Witness To Jesus Christ.*
_(Tuesday 3rd May 2022. Read 1 Corinthians 15:1-8, Psalm 19:2-5, John 14:6-14)_ 

_*‚ÄúVery truly, I tell you, the one who believes in me will also do the works that I do and, in fact, will do greater works than these, because I am going to the Father. If in my name you ask me for anything, I will do it.‚Äù (John 14:12-14)*_

Today we celebrate Saints Philip and James, two of the twelve apostles. In reflecting on their lives, we come to the realization that God does not call the qualified but qualifies those who make themselves available. In other words, when it comes to witnessing for Jesus Christ, there is no need for anyone to look down on himself.

None of the twelve apostles was a perfect human being. For instance, in today‚Äôs Gospel passage, Jesus asked Philip: ‚ÄúHave I been with you so long and yet you do not know me?‚Äù Philip ate and drank with Jesus for three years and still, he did not know that Jesus is God. Philip did not know that to have seen Jesus is to have seen God. Yet, Jesus did not give him immediate dismissal from the college of apostles.

Like Philip and James, we are called to put our imperfections behind us and allow the Holy Spirit to use us. It will not be by your own ability but by the grace of God. Jesus himself says: ‚ÄúWhatever you ask in my name, I will do it that the Father may be glorified in the Son.‚Äù 

In today‚Äôs first reading, St. Paul speaks of the various apparitions of Jesus Christ after His resurrection from the dead. St. Paul is convinced that Jesus followed a hierarchy of importance in choosing who to appear to. First, Jesus appeared to Peter, then to the twelve, then to a group of about five thousand believers before appearing to James, and last, of all, Jesus appeared to Paul.

The very fact that Jesus chose to appear to James personally is a testament to his importance in the college of apostles. As we celebrate St. Philip and James today, we pray that God will continue to inspire labourers for His vineyard.

Let us pray: Lord Jesus, help me to think less of myself and more of you in responding to your call. Amen

*Be Happy. Live Positive. Have Faith. It is well with you. (Saints Philip and James, Apostles ‚Äì Feast. Bible Study: 1 Cor. 15:1-8, Ps. 19:2-5, John 14:6-14)*

5/4/22, 1:46 AM - Chinedu Madu: *Sorrow May Last in the Night, but Joy Comes in the Morning.*
_(Wednesday 4th May 2022. Read Acts 8:1-8, Ps.66:1-7, John 6:35-40)_ 

_*‚ÄúThis is indeed the will of my Father, that all who see the Son and believe in him may have eternal life; and I will raise them up on the last day.‚Äù (John 6:40)*_

Our first reading today begins by telling us that great persecution arose against the church following the death of Stephen, but ends with this line: ‚ÄúSo there was much joy in that city.‚Äù (Acts 8:8). God knows how to write straight on crooked lines. 

We can completely trust God because so long as we hold on to him, even our most negative experiences often turn out to be for our own good. Perhaps Philip would not have known he had the gifts of preaching and healing to work great signs if he had not fled Jerusalem at the time of the persecution. 

Truly, you never know what God has deposited in you until you face hard times. Like food that has to be cooked before its nutritional value for our health comes out, hardship and crisis help to cook us in the fire so that our true value comes out. As Denzel Washington once said: ‚ÄúEase is a greater threat to progress than hardship.‚Äù 

God never promised that if we serve him, everything will be smooth in our lives. No! The book of Sirach 2:1 says: ‚ÄúMy child when you come to serve the Lord, prepare yourself for an ordeal.‚Äù Jesus also makes us understand that following him entails carrying a cross, drinking the bitter wine of persecution: 

‚ÄúYou will be delivered up even by parents and brothers and kinsmen and friends, and some of you they will put to death; you will be hated by all for my name's sake. But not a hair of your head will perish. By your endurance, you will gain your lives.‚Äù (Luke 21:16-19). In Matthew‚Äôs version of this passage, Jesus adds: ‚ÄúWhen they persecute you in one town, flee to the next; for truly, I say to you, you will not have gone through all the towns of Israel, before the Son of man comes.‚Äù (Matthew 10:23).

In today‚Äôs Gospel passage, Jesus continues his conversation with the crowd who had come to seek him because they wanted bread and he is now telling them that he himself is the bread they must eat not only to sustain our life on earth but even to guarantee eternal life for ourselves. 

When we juxtapose both our first reading and our Gospel passage today together, this is the picture we get: Trials and hard times would surely come our way as long as we continue to serve God, we may even lose our lives due to such trials but even if we die, Jesus promises to raise us up on the last day. 

Let us pray: Lord Jesus, save me from all forms of discouragement and despair. Keep my faith alive and strong no matter what life throws at me, may nothing ever spoil my relationship with you. Amen.

*Be Happy. Live Positive. Have Faith. It is well with you. (Wednesday of the 3rd week of Eastertide. Bible Study: Acts 8:1-8, Ps.66:1-7, John 6:35-40)*

5/5/22, 1:58 AM - Chinedu Madu: *When the Student is Ready, the Teacher Appears*
_(Thursday 5th May 2022. Read Acts 8:26-40, Ps. 66:8-9,16-17,20, John 6:44-51)_ 

_*‚ÄúThen the Spirit said to Philip, ‚ÄòGo over to this chariot and join it.‚Äô So, Philip ran up to it and heard him reading the prophet Isaiah. He asked, ‚ÄòDo you understand what you are reading?‚Äô He replied, "How can I, unless someone guides me?‚Äù (Acts 8:29-31)*_

The story of the Ethiopian Eunuch in Acts, chapter 8 reveals to us that there is more to life than what meets the eye. We literally encounter angels daily without knowing it. Just as God sent Philip to the Ethiopian Eunuch, God sends certain people our way for certain reasons. The book of Hebrew warns: ‚ÄúDo not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for by doing that some have entertained angels without knowing it.‚Äù (Hebrews 13:2)

Treat everyone you meet with kindness because whether you admit it or not, there is a Divine Plan in progress. God, the master planner sets things in place and arranges events. To the Ethiopian Eunuch, it was just a coincidence that Philip joined his chariot at a time he needed someone to explain the scriptures to him. Reading the story now, we can see that it was not an ordinary coincidence. 

You may wonder, does it mean that everything has been arranged already? Yes and No. Yes, because God has plans for every moment of our lives. (Cf. Jeremiah 29:11). No, because God gives us the power of choice. We can alter these plans if we refuse to heed the voice of God deep within us. The Spirit spoke to Philip instructing him to join this particular chariot. Philip could have resisted the prompting of the Holy Spirit. Who knows? God could have sent someone else and on the day of Judgement, Philip would have to answer for it. (Cf. Matthew 24:45-51)

On the other hand, this experience teaches us that when we are ready for God, (when we sincerely desire to get close to God; drop our bad habits, deepen our understanding of the scriptures), etc. God is very happy and He does everything to help us grow. As the saying goes: ‚ÄúWhen the student is ready, the teacher appears.‚Äù This is what Jesus confirms in our Gospel passage when he said: ‚ÄúNo one can come to me unless the Father draws him.‚Äù (John 6:44) And as James puts it: ‚ÄúDraw near to God and he will draw near to you.‚Äù (James 4:8).  

For his attempt to read the scriptures, the Eunuch did not just get a deeper understanding of God‚Äôs word, he also received baptism. Truly, when our desire to know God increases in our hearts, when we are open to His Word and make efforts to read the Bible, we should bear in mind that such actions do not go unnoticed in heaven. God takes note of every firm resolution we make. Jesus told us: ‚ÄúI tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance.‚Äù (Luke 15:7)

If there is so much joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, if God is happy to send people our way when we make efforts to come close to Him, it means that God is not happy when we decide to walk away from Him. 

Let us pray: Lord Jesus, send good people my way daily that I may grow in Spirit. Amen

*Be Happy. Live Positive. Have Faith. It is well with you. (Thursday of the 3rd week of Eastertide. Bible Study: Acts 8:26-40, Ps. 66:8-9,16-17,20, John 6:44-51)*

5/6/22, 3:42 AM - Chinedu Madu: *Whoever Eats Me Will Live Because of Me - Jesus*
_(Friday 6th May 2022. Read Acts 9:1-20, Ps. 117, John 6:52-59)_ 

_*‚ÄúThose who eat my flesh and drink my blood abide in me, and I in them.  Just as the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so whoever eats me will live because of me.‚Äù (John 6:56-57)*_

Just as it wasn‚Äôt a mere coincidence that the Ethiopian Eunuch met Philip, it wasn‚Äôt an ordinary coincidence that Saul met Ananias. God is totally in control of everything that happens on earth. The saying is true: ‚ÄúWhen we entrust our lives to God, we begin the see the hand of God in everything.‚Äù 

Saul set out with letters authorising him to persecute Christians but Jesus dramatically arrested him on the way to Damascus. ‚ÄúSaul, Saul, why do you persecute me?‚Äù asked Jesus. This question reveals one sublime truth: that Christians are literally the body of Christ. Anyone who is fighting a Christian is fighting Christ. Anyone is who making life difficult for you just because you are a Christian is contending with God.

In today‚Äôs Gospel passage, Jesus continues his conversation with the crowd who had earlier on eaten their fill of the loaves and fishes. They wanted Jesus to work the miracle again but Jesus told him to labour for bread that lasts forever. When the crowd demanded this bread, Jesus made it clear that He is himself the bread of life. 

Jesus wasn‚Äôt speaking figuratively. Jesus literally meant what He said: ‚ÄúHe who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him‚Äù ‚ÄúHe who eats me will live because of me‚Äù ‚ÄúHe who eats this bread will live forever.‚Äù There is a fine saying that you are what you eat. When we eat Jesus‚Äô flesh in Holy Communion, we become part of Jesus. Jesus abides in us and we in Jesus. This is why when Jesus appeared to Saul on his way to Damascus, Jesus asked: ‚ÄúWhy do you persecute me?‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúWhy are you persecuting Christians?‚Äù

If we understand what happens each time we receive Holy communion, we would realize that we have the best protection any human being can ever have. Just as Jesus protected the Christians in Damascus from Saul‚Äôs raid, Jesus would surely protect you from the plans of your enemies whether known or unknown. Jesus assures us that whoever eats Him will live because of Him. No one can cut short your life because you are a child of communion ‚Äì you are not just anybody.

Again, knowing that we are part of Jesus through our reception of Holy Communion let us strive to live holy and sinless lives. Above all, while people looked at Saul and saw in him a murderer and a terrorist, God saw in Saul an instrument of the Gospel. Jesus did not arrest Saul just to punish him, rather Jesus transformed Saul into a minister of the Gospel. Avoid praying for your enemies to die, instead, pray that God may so use them for good as He did with Saul who later became Paul.

Let us pray: Lord Jesus, may I worthily receive your body and blood. Work in me and through me for good. Amen

*Be Happy. Live Positive. Have Faith. It is well with you. (Friday of the 3rd week of Eastertide. Bible Study: Acts 9:1-20, Ps. 117, John 6:52-59)*

5/6/22, 3:39 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: ENGR.  Osobase Akhere-Ugbesia (OAU)‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúAGAINST THE ODDS‚Ä¶. A NEW BREED RALLYING POINT.

The major reason why the youth do not show interest in politics is because of lack of funds and the domineering influence of the older Politicians.

Truth be told the older ones have done their bit in all facets of life including politics. Continuing to hold on to the political system with a chokehold for whatever reason is doing a great disservice to them and their legacy.

 
When OAU intimated people about his desire to run, they expressed strong reservations about it, holding on to the fact that as a youth he did not have the money required for the race. Other reasons were security and safety. 

Unfortunately, the OAU Team has experienced even more challenges (beyond the money talk) by being prevented from receiving an equal and fair opportunity as other aspirants have enjoyed.

While other House of Representatives and Senatorial aspirants in the Edo Central Senatorial District were afforded the opportunity to meet with delegates at the comfort of an agreed venue arranged by Party Chieftains, thereby saving cost of logistics as well as eliminating the exposure to security threats by moving around, TeamOAU was made to source out the delegates themselves, moving from ward to ward within the Federal Constituency. They were not deterred by that.

This act turned out to be a blessing in itself as it afforded TeamOAU the opportunity to see and experience firsthand the struggles and challenges the people are faced with. As a result of this, TeamOAU was the first of all other aspirants to complete a tour of all the wards in the Federal Constituency.
 

This is what politics used to and should be. Not the lazy style of politicking we are experiencing today. TeamOAU out rightly refuses to be spoon-fed, given handouts, or preferential treatment all in the name of having a heavyweight last name or a financial war chest. These factors or sentiments have no place in determining an individual's capacity to deliver desired results.

TeamOAU has been determined to put in the work and are grateful that this is exactly what they are doing.

It's about time to open up the Political space to allow new entrants that are young, dynamic, vibrant, tech savvy and innovative, not to eradicate the old order, but to bring about an enhanced method of doing things. One that will be a hybrid version - a fusion of old and experienced with new and dynamic. This is the way to go.

This is the time for the younger crop of politicians to have a rallying point that will earn their way into the system and thereafter begin to ascend the political ladder for the overall interest and service of the people.

Engr. Osobase Akhere ‚Äì Ugbesia (KSJI) is offering to be that rallying point, serving as a bridge between the older folks and the ever present/willing youth. He remains unbent and unbroken from all the actions aimed at derailing his aspiration. 
His desire to continue moving forward (ODALO) despite repeated but failed attempts to get him to step down is premised on the inevitable and inescapable conclusion that failure of the youth to come on board and assist in steering this ship of our dear Federal Constituency and nation as a whole will ultimately lead to a point where the youth are handed over a broken and totally ruined nation.

Engr. Osobase Akhere ‚Äì Ugbesia is determined to give vibrant, eloquent and purposeful representation to the people of Esan North-East/ Esan South-East Federal Constituency if given the opportunity to fly the flag of the PDP and subsequently elected to represent the people at the Federal House of Representatives come 2023.

 
Support and Nominate Engr. OSOBASE AKHERE-UGBESIA (KSJI) for Federal House of Representatives Esan North-east and Esan South-East Federal Constituency.
Egbase Ofure

5/6/22, 4:34 PM - Osa Eweka: South West APC Elders meeting with Osinbajo, Tinubu, others affirm rights of all aspirants to contest 

A South West APC Elders meeting with presidential, gubernatorial and National Assembly aspirants from the zone ended tonight on a convivial note, as sources confirm that the leaders resolved that every aspirants has a right to contest.

Besides, the meeting, though behind closed doors also resolved that name callings and other personal attacks should no longer be encouraged by aspirants and their supporters.

According to an inside source, "the issue of betrayal was put to rest as the elders affirmed that everyone who desires to run for any political office whatsoever is not encumbered in any way at all." The leaders and the aspirants all agreed to conduct a rancour free campaign.

The meeting had been convened by the first Chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief Bisi Akande and a former Governor of Ogun state, Chief Segun Osoba, both of whom served as Co-Conveners.

Present at the meeting were the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, former Lagos State Governor Bola Ahmed Tinubu and the Ekiti State Governor Kayode Fayemi.
Also at the meeting, apart from the aspirants were the former Governor of Lagos State and Works and Housing Minister Mr. Babatunde Fashola, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr Femi Gbajabiamila, Chief Niyi Adebayo, Governors Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo state, Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun state and Governor Oyetola of Osun state. Others included former Osun State Governor and Interior Minister Rauf Aregbesola and the APC National Secretary Otunba Iyiola Omisore.


While commending the Vice President, being the highest ranking public officer from South West extraction for a job well done, inside sources disclosed that the APC elders stated categorically that all the aspirants had the right to aspire to be President.  But, they enjoined all aspirants to exhibit the ‚ÄòOmoluabi‚Äô ethos in their politicking by shunning divisive rhetorics.

While stating that consultations with them would be a continuous exercise, the meeting admonished the aspirants to queue behind whoever amongst them that eventually emerges as the party‚Äôs candidate, stating that the cohesion of the South West must be sancrosanct.

5/8/22, 2:36 AM - Chinedu Madu: *My Sheep Hear My Voice, I Know them and They Follow Me.*
_(Sunday 8th May 2022. Read Acts 13:14,43-52, Ps. 100:1-3,5, Rev. 7:9,14-17, John 10:27-30)_ 

_*‚ÄúMy sheep hear my voice. I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they will never perish. No one will snatch them out of my hand.‚Äù (John 10:27-28)*_

Last Sunday, we heard Jesus saying to Peter: ‚ÄúFeed My Sheep, Tend My Sheep, Feed My lambs.‚Äù Jesus forgave Peter for his three-fold denial and restored him as Shepherd (Leader) of the Church. Jesus made it clear to Peter that his primary duty is to feed His sheep. The one word which summarizes our Liturgy today is ‚ÄúCall‚Äù. As Peter and the disciples were called by Jesus to be shepherds, Jesus calls his sheep who hear his voice and follow Him. There are many lessons for us today:

*1. Not Everyone is a Sheep of Christ*
In today‚Äôs Gospel passage, Jesus did not say ‚Äúall those who come to gather around me are my sheep.‚Äù Instead, He says: ‚ÄúMy sheep hear my voice, and I know them and they follow me.‚Äù These three qualities distinguish the sheep of Christ; First, the sheep must hear the voice of Christ. How often do you read the Bible and meditate on it? Secondly, when Christ says ‚ÄúI know them‚Äù it means no one can pretend to be his sheep; you are either with Christ or with another shepherd. Thirdly, Jesus says: ‚Äúthey follow me,‚Äù which means, they behave like me. The sheep of Christ incarnate Christ in the world. 

*2. As Sheep of Christ, We Cannot Escape Hardship*
The call to live as children of God is not an easy one. It is a call for the bold and courageous. The book of Sirach teaches: ‚ÄúMy son, if you come forward to serve the Lord, prepare yourself for temptation. Set your heart right and be steadfast, and do not be hasty in time of calamity.‚Äù (Sirach 2:1-2). Meanwhile, Jesus himself warns: ‚ÄúIf any man would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it. For what will it profit a man, if he gains the whole world and forfeits his life?‚Äù (Matthew 16:24-26).

The story of Paul and Barnabas in our first reading today teaches us that this call is loaded with challenges, tough times, and persecution. And more painfully, much of this persecution comes from people who are supposed to be close to God. The Jewish religious leaders upon seeing the multitudes of those becoming Christians were filled with jealousy and they went as far as inciting devout women of high standing and the leading men of the city against Paul and Barnabas. In the end, they were driven out of the city but this did not dampen their spirits. 

*3. As a Sheep of Christ, Ensure Your Robes are Washed Clean*
In our second reading, St. John sees a vision of heaven, and behold it was a great multitude consisting of persons from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and tongues. This means that the only language we shall speak in heaven is the language of love. 

St. John reveals: ‚ÄúThese are they who have come out of the great tribulation‚Ä¶‚Äù That is to say, those who did not give up despite the persecution and trials they face. Jesus says in today‚Äôs Gospel passage, ‚ÄúI give them eternal life, and they shall never perish, and no one can snatch them out of my hand.‚Äù (John 10:28). 

Furthermore, St. John says: ‚Äúthey have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb‚Äù that is, those who have not given themselves over to a sinful life. 

*4. As Sheep, let us pray for our Shepherds*
If there is anything we owe our shepherds, it is prayer. This is because, despite being humans like us, they are entrusted with the task that only angels can do. When the priest is doing very well, he is hardly appreciated but when his weaknesses become obvious, he becomes the talk of the town. Before I entered the seminary, I thought priests were immune from temptation, that having gone to the seminary, they become semi-deities but I later realized these were childhood fantasies. Although the priesthood carries with it several helps to the attainment of all virtues, it takes the grace of God for a priest to be a good shepherd.

As we pray for our shepherds, let us also pray that God may send more labourers into the harvest. In other words, let us endeavour to actively support and encourage more vocations to the priesthood and religious life. If your child tells you that he or she wants to become a priest or sister, please do not discourage him or her. It may sound like a joke but if God has put such a desire in their hearts, God will hold you responsible for not allowing them to answer this call. 

The existence of bad shepherds should never be an excuse for discouraging the little ones. Rather than say, ‚ÄúGod forbid‚Äù when your child sincerely desires to become a priest (or religious), join in the training of that child. Very often the shepherd only mirrors the society and more specifically, the family he comes from. On the other hand, it is true that the call to priesthood or religious life is literally a call to poverty but this should not make you discourage the little ones from responding to it. Trust that whatever he or she would have done for you, God will provide it in another way for you.

Let us pray: Lord Jesus, help me to hear your voice and follow you diligently. Amen.

*Be Happy. Live Positive. Have Faith. It is well with you. (4th Sunday of Easter. Bible Study: Acts 13:14,43-52, Ps. 100:1-3,5, Rev. 7:9,14-17, John 10:27-30)*

Media Adviser to H.E. Dr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan

It has come to our notice that a group has purportedly purchased Presidential  Nomination and Expression of Interest forms, of the All Progressives Congress APC, in the name of former President Dr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan.
We wish to categorically state that Dr. Jonathan was not aware of this bid and did not authorize it. 
We want to state that if the former President wanted to contest an election, he would make his intentions clear to the public and will not enter through the back door.
While we appreciate the overwhelming request by a cross-section of Nigerians, for Dr. Jonathan to make himself available for the 2023 Presidential election, we wish to state, that he has not in anyway, committed himself to this request. Buying a presidential aspiration form in the name Dr. Jonathan without his consent, knowing the position he had held in this country, is considered an insult to his person. The general public is therefore advised to disregard it.

5/11/22, 12:09 AM - Chinedu Madu: *The Benefits of Prayer and Fasting*
_(Wednesday 11th May 2022. Read Acts 12:24-13:5, Ps. 67:2-3,5-6,8, John 12:44-50)_ 

_*‚ÄúI have come as light into the world, that whoever believes in me may not remain in darkness.‚Äù (John 12:46)*_

It was at Antioch that people were for the first time called Christians. In today‚Äôs first reading, we hear more about this model Christian community at Antioch. It was not just a gathering of persons who behaved like Christ, but it was also a gifted community; a community of prophets, teachers, and prayer warriors.

Without prayer, we are powerless. Without prayer, we are deaf (that is, unable to hear from God), without prayer we are blind (unable to see the hand of God in our lives), and without prayer we are dumb (unable to speak blessings over our lives). Jesus taught us: ‚ÄúAbide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me.‚Äù (John 15:4)

We learn from the Church in Antioch that fasting is an essential component of prayer. When we fast, we involve our whole body in prayer. Fasting helps us to silence the noises around us and feel the real hunger of our souls which is the hunger for God. When we fast, we face our fears, we realize we can survive without certain things, and we become aware of the inner power that we possess over food, luxury, or that which we had depended on for so long. St. Paul says: ‚ÄúI pommel my body and subdue it, lest after preaching to others I myself should be disqualified.‚Äù (1 Corinthians 9:25-27). 

Fasting enables us to develop self-control, it also opens our ears to hear more clearly from God. In Luke Chapter 2, we read about Anna the prophetess who never left the temple but was there worshipping God with fasting and prayer. The moment she saw the baby Jesus, she immediately recognized Him as the Messiah. This was exactly what happened in the Church in Antioch. While they were praying and fasting, they heard the voice of the Holy Spirit saying: ‚ÄúSet apart Barnabas and Saul for the work I have called them.‚Äù 

In our Gospel passage today, Jesus says to us: ‚ÄúI have come as light into the world, that whoever believes in me may not remain in darkness.‚Äù (John 12:46). Faith in God is like a torchlight that gives us extra powers to navigate through places that others cannot see. 

This is how it works; with faith, you acknowledge the existence of God. You also become conscious that God sees you and listens to you when you pray and fast. As such your prayer goes beyond words, it is not just a monologue but a dialogue. 

Let us pray: Lord Jesus, teach me to discipline myself so as to hear more and more from you daily. Amen

*Be Happy. Live Positive. Have Faith. It is well with you. (Wednesday of the 4th week of Eastertide. Bible Study: Acts 12:24-13:5, Ps. 67:2-3,5-6,8, John 12:44-50)*

Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari has directed that all members of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) running for elective offices submit their letters of resignation on or before Monday the 16th of May, 2022.


Nigeria information and culture minister Lai Mohamed disclosed this on Wednesday during the Federal Executive Council meeting.

He said that the directive excludes the Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, because he is an elected member of the cabinet.

Mohammed affirmed that if there are any amendments or additions to this directive they would be made shortly.

He said the directive might involve political appointees if the need arises

5/12/22, 3:55 AM - Chinedu Madu: *God‚Äôs Work is Servant‚Äôs Work*
_(Thursday 12th May 2022. Read Acts 13:13-25, Ps. 89:2-3,21,22,25,27, John 13:16-20)_ 

_*‚ÄúTruly, truly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master; nor is he who is sent greater than he who sent him.‚Äù (John 13:16)*_

One of the temptations of Jesus after his forty-day fast was a temptation to PRIDE. Satan told Jesus to let himself fall from the pinnacle of the temple in the presence of the people so that by so doing, God would send Angels to prevent him from falling and people would begin to revere him assuming he fell from heaven to the earth.

This temptation remains forever rife among ministers of God today; it is the temptation to make ourselves appear larger-than-life, greater than the ordinary, a temptation to make people believe we are closer to God and so, higher, more important, more sophisticated, more intelligent, wiser than other human beings. 

At times, we speak as though we even hold face to face meetings with God and the Angels daily or that what we hear, no one else can hear. In today‚Äôs Gospel passage, Jesus describes the work of God as a servant‚Äôs duty. The man of God is not greater than the people of God; he is their servant; not their lord.

Are you involved in ministry in any capacity? Church warden, lay-reader, catechism teacher, Sunday school coordinator, mass server, sacristan, altar decorator, member of the executive in church societies, seminarian or priest/religious. Be conscious of the great temptation to pride. 

In carrying out your duties, there are always many who will admire you not because you are good-looking or talented but because you represent God. They would complement you sometimes, they would even obey your instructions without questioning regardless of your age or educational qualification. Never forget that without God, you are nothing. Do not let pride get into you. 

Doing God‚Äôs work without a sense of humility, that is, without an awareness that you are just an instrument in God‚Äôs toolbox is dangerous (you can easily be replaced). Never take the complements or testimonies personally, learn to direct glory to God. In the same way, do not take it personally when you encounter those who express their anger against God through you. You are just a servant, the work is not yours.

In our first reading today, we hear Paul preach for the first time since his conversion. Will a man who once hated Christianity with a passion suddenly turn around on his own volition and start promoting God‚Äôs kingdom? This shows us the extent of God‚Äôs power. God can use anybody, including that man or that woman that you think is most unqualified.

Let us pray: Lord Jesus, instil in me the virtue of humility and service. Amen.

*Be Happy. Live Positive. Have Faith. It is well with you. (Thursday of the 4th week of Eastertide. Bible Study: Acts 13:13-25, Ps. 89:2-3,21,22,25,27, John 13:16-20)*

For now, he can‚Äôt be making utterances that will affect his chances of winning the elections. It makes perfect sense to withdraw that statement, if he really did; but if u follow atiku, u will know that he normally condemns such acts, down to the last rape in that boarding school. He is very much in tune with the happenings in the country, unlike buhari. 

But For now, he has to play the role of a politician, he has to be careful. 

Which normal person would say something that would affect their chances of getting something? 

Make u go US embassy for interview go dey talk nonsense, or go work interview go dey talk nonsense na?

5/13/22, 7:42 AM - Chinedu Madu: *Let Not Your Hearts Be Troubled*
_(Friday 13th May 2022. Read Acts 13:26-33, Ps. 2:6-11, John 14:1-6)_ 

_*‚ÄúLet not your hearts be troubled; believe in God, believe also in me.‚Äù (John 14:1)*_

Today, Jesus beautifully assures us: ‚Äúlet not your hearts be troubled.‚Äù How? We may ask. Jesus says: ‚ÄúBelieve in God, believe also in me.‚Äù So long as we are still on earth, there would always be something to make us worried. 

Being worried is not a reflex action, it is how we choose to react to the events of our lives. When we worry, we attempt to use our minds to control our world but it never works; worry doesn‚Äôt change anything. We have the power to decide not to worry no matter what is going on.

‚ÄúIn my Father‚Äôs house are many rooms.‚Äù With this statement, Jesus seeks to draw our attention away from this world; to make us think of heaven itself. In truth, none of our problems (the things that worry us now) will be relevant in heaven. 

Jesus has already gone to prepare a place of rest and peace for us. We cannot live forever on earth. We are only pilgrims here. Pray, do what you can, and leave the let God do the rest. Having committed a problem in God‚Äôs hands, you are not permitted to take it back. Worrying about something you have prayed for already is a sign of doubting what God can do. 

In today‚Äôs first reading, St. Paul teaches us that Jesus Christ was persecuted by a people he came to save. Even though they did not recognise Jesus as the long-awaited Messiah, they helped bring to fulfilment all the prophecies concerning Jesus. The people who killed Jesus did not even know they were helping to prove his authenticity as the Messiah. 

Think of it this way: those people making life difficult for you now may just be helping to bring out the best in you. If Peninnah had not provoked Hannah to tears, do you think she would have prayed for a child in the way she did to the extent that Eli thought she was drunk? Let not your heart be troubled. God knows why things are the way they are today. Keep trusting Him.

Thomas wanted to be very sure so he asked Jesus for the way. And Jesus said, ‚ÄúI am the way, the truth, and the life.‚Äù In other words, nothing is certain in this life, there are no guarantees; Jesus alone is our guarantee. Jesus alone is the way. 

Let us pray: Lord Jesus, increase my faith and cast away my fears and worries. Amen

*Be Happy. Live Positive. Have Faith. It is well with you. (Friday of the 4th week of Eastertide. Bible Study: Acts 13:26-33, Ps. 2:6-11, John 14:1-6)*

5/14/22, 6:13 AM - Chinedu Madu: *Chosen by God, Yet Not Indispensable*
_(Saturday 14th May 2022. Read Acts 1:15-17,20-26, Ps. 113:1-8, John 15:9-17)_ 

_*‚ÄúAnd they prayed and said, ‚ÄòLord, who knowest the hearts of all men, show which one of these two thou hast chosen to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside, to go to his own place.‚Äô And they cast lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias; and he was enrolled with the eleven apostles.‚Äù (Acts 1:24-26)*_

God who made you and chose you without your permission will not save you without your cooperation. In today‚Äôs gospel passage, Jesus reminds us that we have been chosen; chosen to keep his commandments, chosen to bear fruits ‚Äì fruits that will last. If we fail to live up to the expectations of our calling, God will raise up others to bear the expected fruits.

In Matthew 3:9, Jesus warns: ‚ÄúDo not presume to say to yourselves, ‚Äòwe have Abraham as our ancestor‚Äô for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham.‚Äù In other words, the fact that we are descendants of Abraham, Christians or ministers of God is not an automatic qualification for heaven. Even if we fail like Judas Iscariot, we must make efforts to seek God‚Äôs forgiveness like Peter did after he denied Jesus. Avoid the sin of despair; never think that there is any sin God cannot forgive.

The election of Saint Mathias whose feast we celebrate today teaches us that no matter how good we are, there would always be someone who can take our place. We have been chosen by God but our election does not mean we have become indispensable. The will of God must be done and the work of God has to continue. If you serve in any capacity in God‚Äôs house, avoid pride; be good to people, never think that without you, everything will end.
 
Another lesson we learn from this election is to always consult God in prayer. ‚ÄúAnd they prayed and said, ‚ÄòLord who knows the hearts of all men, show us which one of these two you have chosen to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from Judas turned aside, to go to his own place‚Äù (Acts 1:24-25). They prayed; they were not carried away by dirty politics.

Again, we learn from the election of Mathias is the importance of building the right relationships. Both Mathias and Joseph Justus were friends to the Apostles. As Peter noted: ‚ÄúSo one of the men who has accompanied us during all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, beginning from the baptism of John until the day when he was taken up from us - one of these men must become with us a witness to his resurrection‚Äù (Acts 1:21-22). 

The kind of friends you keep determine your future. Matthias was elected based on his association with Jesus and the twelve apostles. Be mindful of the company you keep. If you do not associate with those going the same direction with you, you could lose your destined place in life.

According to Wikipedia, St. Matthias planted the faith in Cappadocia and on the coasts of the Caspian Sea, residing chiefly near the port Issus. The Synopsis of Dorotheus contains this tradition: ‚ÄúMatthias preached the Gospel to barbarians and meat-eaters in the interior of Ethiopia, where the sea harbour of Hyssus is, at the mouth of the river Phasis. He died at Sebastopolis, and was buried there, near the Temple of the Sun.‚Äù Another tradition maintains that Matthias was stoned at Jerusalem by the Jews, and then beheaded.

Let us pray: Lord Jesus, like St. Mathias may I use my gifts and opportunities in life according to your good pleasure. Amen.

*Be Happy. Live Positive. Have Faith. It is well with you. (Saint Matthias, Apostle ‚Äì Feast. Bible Study: Acts 1:15-17,20-26, Ps. 113:1-8, John 15:9-17)*

#WeCantContinueLikeThis #RevolutionNow

BOOM!!!

To those who don't know how the current hardship and poverty in Nigeria started, take your time and read this. Then investigate the owners of the companies that robbed the country of her assets, those are the devils you were warned about

Read;
HOW OBASANJO, ATIKU MADE NIGERIANS JOBLESS.

A. NigerDock is the largest ship fabrication yard in West Africa sub region. When it was sold, its Ex-MD Engr. Nkpubre Okon, openly stated how "Mr Job Creator" ignored the Transport Ministry then to Open bid for NigerDock.

 Atiku's preferred bidder, 'Global Energy' that agreed to increase NigerDock's workforce from 4,800 to 6,000 as part of privatization agreement dismissed 2,200 immediately it took ownership. Jagal Group that took over after Global Energy lost out on power play also sacked 1,400.

 B. Nigeria Port Authority reform was purely contrived to grab landed properties. 10,000 workers were sacked & 133 bids opened for NPA properties consisting of 68 properties in Apapa, 28 houses in Ikoyi. The highest reserves bid was for a property in Ikoyi fixed at N390.4 Million.

 C. NIGERIA RAILWAY
Did Atiku forget how 7000 railway workers were sacked in 2005 without compensation to reduce its workforce to 6,300? Another 1,260 were fired in 2006. When ATIKU and his Headmaster were leaving in 2007, they left ~N5 Billion in unpaid Railway pension arrears.

 D. FEDERAL SECRETARIAT IKOYI
In 2006, Babalakin's Resort Ltd acquired this 15 storeys prime asset overgrown with weeds from atiku and OBJ through a Development Lease Agreement (DLA) for N7.2Billion. A Court has asked Buhari to pay N54 Billion to Babalakin for that blunder. 

The DLA, dated October 10, 2006, granted Babalakin Resort Ltd a 99-years lease to redevelop the Federal Secretariat complex, that OBJ & ATIKU had  abandoned for 7 years into 480 luxury apartments. This was at the eve of their departure from government. The transaction was one for the road.

 The DLA hit the rocks when Lagos State Govt in the interest of the public indicated willingness in acquiring the Federal Secretariat complex. LASG insisted it should be accorded right of first refusal since LASG is the Issuing Authority of the C of O, coupled with other reasons.

 Lets not forget Atiku was in charge of the economy and OBJ gave him free hand until Galaxy Backbone scandal happened.

 In 2002, first 3yrs of the Obasanjo/Atiku, manufacturing accounts for 6% of GDP. Nigeria's GDP fell by half for d first time in 20yrs. This was d year all textile factories in Nigeria closed down and unemployment was 28% within the formal sector alone; I repeat, alone!!

 In 2002, UN estimated that 70% of Nigerians live below poverty line compared to 48.5% in 1998 under a military rule. Life expectancy fell from 54yrs to 51yrs. Two-fifth of every child below age 5 were malnourished and only 50% of the 128Million Nigerians have access to clean water.

copied:-
FACTUAL REPORT ON HOW ATIKU  SUPERVISED THE SALES OF OVER 145 FG INVESTMENTS AS A VICE PRESIDENT !!!

Please any or all ATIKU supporters or his campaign structure are free to deny these submission with facts not sentiments.

‚ÄúAs Head of National Council on Privatization (NCP), from 1999, atiku dug Nigeria's economic grave for today's extreme poverty and unemployment. 

There were over 600 federal assets when Atiku's NCP started selling. 

Atiku  should tell us who bought what and what was left for the country when he left power. 
To who did Atiku sell the following companies:

Nafcon
Eleme Petrochemical 
Daily Times
Ughelli Power
Egbin Power
NICON Insurance
ALSCON
Transcorp Hilton Hotel
NICON Luxury Hotel
Sunti Sugar Ltd
NetCom House
Bacita Sugar Ltd
MM2

In 2007, Onigbolo Cement operating at 500,000 tonnes per annum was sold to Dangote at N1.7Bn üòÇ

To those selling Atiku, let me remind you of Senate public hearing of August, 2011 which succinctly captures how Atiku through retinue of cohorts, fronts, shell companies, ring fenced over 70% of FG's assets through a brazen daylight robbery privatization that he supervised.

This is nothing sensational. Its real life facts and all the Senators are alive today. 

The 2011 privatization Senate committee was made up of Senator Ahmed Lawan ‚Äì Chairman, Senators Babafemi Ojudu, Philip Aduda, Mohammed Ndume, Ifeanyi Okowa, Hope Uzodinma and Mohammadu Magoro.

Lets look at Aluminium Smelting Company, ALSCON, that Atiku privatized. 

ALSCON which Nigeria built with $3.2 billion, was sold to a Russian firm, Russal, for $130million. As of the time of sale, ALSCON had received $120million for the dredging of Imo River, but was never done.

When the Senate Sitting of August, 2011 asked the Russian company the whereabouts of the $120million dredging money, the company's Deputy Managing Director, Vitaly Kuzrestov, said that the money has been used for Environment Impact Assessment." 

FG's Five percent share in Eleme Petrochemical worth USD27 million was never presented at the National Council on Privatization before it was sold to Indorama. 

Indorama recovered this amount selling Polyethylene and Urea to the entire west Africa sub-region in just 14 months.

The Atikulate Business Theory: Sell to yourself Government assets that leaves millions in penury, to set up personal businesses that provides for a few. Atiku didn't employ the few hundreds he employed because he likes them, he needs them to work to preserve what he took from Government

A man who supervised sales of over 145 federal investments as a vice president, without a thought for today wants to be president. 

He didnt revitalize them. 

He didnt resuscitate them. 

He sold them to whomever agrees to his personal terms

THOSE WHO STOLE YOUR 2015--2030 IN 1999--2007 ARE THE SAME THIEVES YOU ARE NOW ROMANCING TO COME BACK!!!

For how long will you allow a few to steal your future and your children's future and be giving you crumbs. Look at 1999--2007 everything we  grew up to know were sold to themselves or the scrap sold for cash.

Nigeria Airways and their houses in GRA Ikeja, what happened to them? When we were growing up most of the houses in GRA Ikeja were owned by the Nigeria Airways and all now sold to whom?
Nigeria RE. The biggest re insurance company in Africa who bought it?
NICON Insurance who bought it ?
NITEL was sold for peanuts and killed by them so that their investment in AiRTEL, MTN,GLO etc will yield dividends
NITEL House one of the tallest in Marina was sold cheap to former Speaker Bankole.
What is the Status of National Stadium Surulere? Millions was budgeted for refurbishment by the  sports ministry and nothing to show. Compare that stadium to Lagos State owned Thunder Balogun stadium and the difference is clear .
Nigerian National Shipping  line? Where are the ships? They disappeared between 1999-2015
NEPA after Obasanjo spent $16 billion, they broke down NEPA to several units and sold it to themselves and NEPA is still not efficient while Atiku's Mikano Generators is powering Nigeria & her businesses! 
Obasanjo/Atiku sold Port Harcourt Refinery to their cronies in 2007 and thank God, President Yar‚Äô Adua reversed it .

All of these happened in the 8 disastrous locust years of the obasanjo/Atiku, Recession didn't just happen! They looted us into recession! I cannot stand and watch those who plundered the nation come back in 2023. Stop praising and voting for individuals who took your future away and stop them from coming back to steal your generation away 

Nigeria has a population of 200million people we are told.

Our 2018 budget is 9 trillion Naira.

The Assets Management Corporation of Nigeria AMCON, the company that was set up to help the rich buy their debts, told us last month that, 350 Nigerians {out of 200million citizens} are responsible for 80% of AMCON's N5.4 trillion debt portfolio.
May be you did not hear that well!
AMCON said only 350 Nigerians borrowed N5.4trillion from banks, which they could not pay and AMCON came in to buy up those debts in other to save the commercial banks from collapsing.
To put that in perspective;
2018 Capital Budget is N2.4 trillion

2018 Recurrent Budget is N3.4 trillion 

Add both capital and recurrent votes and you will get N5.8 trillion.

But 350 Nigerians, out of 200 million of us borrowed that same amount, they refused to pay and government came round to buy the debts over through AMCON.

The corporation also pointed out that, out of the millions of BVN numbers with the banks, only 100 BVNs collect 60% of bank lendings. 

And this has left the banks with 13,000 bad loans worth 5.6trillion borrowed by "big men" who are now fighting to remove this administration so that they wont ever pay their debts!
Now, when they go to recover from defaulters like they did with Silverbird for example, the same cheated ignorant commoners are the first to cry fowl.
Some of the companies owing include:
Seaworlf Nig Ltd - 160billion
Arik Air - 300billion
Tanzila Petroleum Ltd 49.2billion
Resort Int'l Ltd - 36.3billion
Home Trust Savings - 25.75billion
Suru worldwide ventures - 24.4billion
Roygate properties- 23.26 billion
Ziglagsis network Ltd - 20.33 billion
Lexcap partners - 18billion
Anyiam Osigwe Ltd - 17.25billion
Silverbird - 11 billion
Wokson International - 5 billion

From the figures above:
Arik alone is owing more than the 2018 Ministry of Transportation budget which is N263 billion.
Seaworlf Nig Ltd, is also owing more than the 2018 Ministry of Defence budget which is N145 billion.

It's not rocket science which is a product of our contrived emotions not our lack of education is exonerating, encouraging and  emboldening them to make desperate attempts to come back o power! 

Enough of this madness brethren and sisthren!

5/17/22, 2:41 AM - Chinedu Madu: *The Power and Beauty of Inner Peace.*
_(Tuesday 17th May 2022. Read Acts 14:19-28, Ps. 145:10-13a,21, John 14:27-31)_ 

_*‚ÄúPeace I leave with you; my peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid.‚Äù (John 14:27)*_

In our Gospel passage today, we hear Jesus talking to us about Peace and he specifically mentions that the peace which he wants us to have is different from the peace that the world can afford. This is the peace that keeps you going no matter the trials and difficulties you experience. Hence the moment Jesus says he wants to give us this peace, he immediately went on to say: ‚ÄúLet not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid.‚Äù

Paul is a classic example of a person who had this type of peace. Although he was stoned by his fellow Jews and dragged out of the city and the people assumed he was dead, the following day, he regained consciousness and went back to the same town from which was dragged out ‚Äústrengthening the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and saying that through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God.‚Äù 

How can we possibly accept the many tribulations that are part of the road to heaven? The only solution is for us to have this inner peace. Peace of mind is such a vital ingredient for us to move successfully on this road to heaven. When we have this peace, nothing is difficult for us. The persecutions we have to face from satan and forces of darkness become light and we are just able to handle our trials like Paul did. We are ready for anything and determined to continue to serve God forever. 

Let us pray: Lord Jesus, fill our hearts with your peace so that we may never be discouraged by trials. Amen.

*Be Happy. Live Positive. Have Faith. It is well with you. (Tuesday of the 5th week of Eastertide. Bible Study: Acts 14:19-28, Ps. 145:10-13a,21, John 14:27-31)*

5/18/22, 1:30 AM - Chinedu Madu: *Is There An Easy Ticket To Heaven?*
_(Wednesday 18th May 2022. Read Acts 15:1-6, Ps. 122:1-5, John 15:1-8)_ 

_*‚ÄúAbide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me.‚Äù (John 15:4)*_

Some men came from Judea and were teaching the brethren, ‚ÄúUnless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.‚Äù For these men, circumcision was the only ticket to heaven and as such, if one was not circumcised, no matter how holy he or she may be, there is no chance of salvation. What they failed to realise is that circumcision was just a sign (not the real deal). 

Going back to Genesis 17:10-11, we read: ‚ÄúThis is my covenant, which you shall keep, between me and you and your offspring after you: Every male among you shall be circumcised. You shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskins, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and you.‚Äù Circumcision was a permanent reminder in their own bodies that they were not to be like those who do not worship God. 

The sign circumcision was meant to indicate an agreement between God and the people of Israel but some saw the sign as a ticket to heaven. While ignoring the commandments, they believed that having been circumcised, they would automatically make heaven. There are some Christians today who believe that having been baptised and confirmed, they are sure to make heaven regardless of how they live their lives. 

Brothers and sisters, there is no easy ticket to heaven. Being circumcised will not guarantee salvation. If there is anything that assures us of eternal life, it is the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the Cross of Calvary. ‚ÄúWhen I am lifted up, I will draw all men to myself,‚Äù says Jesus. Nevertheless, faith in the sacrifice of Jesus without corresponding works on our part is useless. St. James would say, faith without works is dead.

In today‚Äôs Gospel passage, Jesus simply tells us what he requires of us. Not external circumcision, but inner connection. ‚ÄúAbide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me.‚Äù The mere fact that we have been baptised (born again) does not mean that we now abide in Jesus, we must make efforts to listen to Jesus every day, obey His commandments, and walk as children of the light.

Jesus adds: ‚ÄúIf you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you.‚Äù (John 15:4-7). There are so many advantages of going the extra mile every day to connect with Jesus. Do not let your religion end with just signs and symbols. Jesus told the Samaritan woman that a time is coming that true believers will worship neither on this mountain nor on that, but they would worship in spirit and in truth.

Let us pray: Lord Jesus, grant me the grace to abide firmly in you always. Amen.

*Be Happy. Live Positive. Have Faith. It is well with you. (Wednesday of the 5th week of Eastertide. Bible Study: Acts 15:1-6, Ps. 122:1-5, John 15:1-8)*

5/21/22, 4:27 AM - Chinedu Madu: *Love Those Who Hate You*
_(Saturday 21st May 2022. Read Acts 16:1-10, Ps. 100:1-3,5, John 15:18-21)_ 

_*‚ÄúIf you were of the world, the world would love its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.‚Äù (John 15:19)*_

Is it possible to love someone who hates you? Yes. This is the challenge Jesus poses for us today. By the example of his own life, Jesus shows us that is possible to love and even die to redeem people that hate you. It was while we were enemies of God, that Jesus died on our behalf to show us that it is possible to love one‚Äôs enemies. (Cf. Romans 5:10)

Ordinarily, one would assume that if we love others as Jesus loved us, they would love us back but the shocking reality is that no matter how much love we give, we still get back hatred. Why does the world hate us so much? Jesus answers: ‚ÄúBecause you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own.‚Äù

Those who belong to the world operate by the principle ‚Äúsurvival of the fittest‚Äù which implies the destruction of the weak. For the worldly-minded, it is a sign of weakness to forgive or spare the life of one who poses a threat to you. This is why St. John and St. James warn us against being worldly-minded. (Cf. 1st John 2:15 & James 4:4). You cannot be worldly-minded and still try to love those who hate you. 

A lot of Christians today cannot accept the teaching of Jesus to love those who hate them because they basically operate by the standards of the worldly-minded. These are those who pray for the death of their haters and would readily take up arms to fight anyone perceived to be an enemy. 

In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus said: ‚ÄúYou have heard that it was said, ‚ÄòYou shall love your neighbour and hate your enemy.‚Äô  But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be children of your Father in heaven.‚Äù (Matthew 5:43-45). That is to say; our unique identity as Christians is that we are a people who love those who hate them. 

We are a mysterious people. We always forgive those who hurt us. We turn the other cheek when someone slaps us on one side. We let others have their way and we pray for God‚Äôs blessings rather than heap curses on our haters. (Cf. Matthew 5:38-39). This is how we melt the hearts of our enemies. This is the principle that has made our religion spread all over the world and continue to grow in leaps and bounds. 

We don‚Äôt believe in fighting on God‚Äôs behalf, we allow God to fight for himself and protect us while we do what He commanded ‚Äì we love everyone including our enemies; including those who insult us or threaten to kill us. Surely, this is hard but Jesus would not recommend it if it is entirely impossible to do. We can love our enemies if we choose to. It takes courage and self-sacrifice ‚Äì it is carrying the cross behind Jesus.

It was with this spirit of self-sacrifice that Paul went about carrying out his mission of evangelization to various towns and villages. Paul did not mind the challenges and persecutions he was facing. He was not discouraged because within his heart, he knew that he did not belong to this world and that even if he died, a better place lay ahead for him. 

Let us pray: Lord Jesus, teach me to love just as you loved. Amen.

*Be Happy. Live Positive. Have Faith. It is well with you. (Saturday of the 5th week of Eastertide. Bible Study: Acts 16:1-10, Ps. 100:1-3,5, John 15:18-21)*

5/24/22, 8:48 PM - Osa Eweka: 2023: 70years Old  Ogbonnaya Onu Reported To Be Buhari's Anointed Candidate 

The Minister of Science and Technology and Innovation, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu, may be President Muhammadu Buhari‚Äôs favourite candidate to carry the flag of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), in the 2023 presidential election.

Although there were speculations yesterday that the screening of the party‚Äôs presidential aspirants earlier scheduled for May 23 may have been postponed to accommodate former President Goodluck Jonathan who is suspected to have submitted his nomination form through the backdoor, insiders suggested a completely different track in confidential discussions with LEADERSHIP last night.

‚ÄúThe press may have got the whole speculation about Jonathan wrong,‚Äù one of the sources with deep connections to the party and the Presidency said. ‚ÄúThe real dark horse, the man to watch, is Ogbonnaya Onu.‚Äù

The source continued: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs because the scales are tipping in Onu‚Äôs favour that President Buhari has delayed the signing of the amendment to the Electoral Act, that may have permitted political appointees to be voting delegates at the primaries.‚Äù

In Nigeria, state governors fund the parties and wield significant control over delegates at election time. Keeping political appointees out of the equation increases governors‚Äô control. At the same time, however, it makes is easier for the President, who still exercises considerable power of patronage, to whip them in line.

Onu is not the only candidate that could potentially benefit from the exclusion of political appointees in a field that boasts over 25 APC aspirants who have submitted nomination forms, but who mostly have weak party structures. The source said, however, that ‚ÄúOnu carries additional appeal and advantage.‚Äù

At 70, age is not one of those advantages in country where there appears to be an increasing demand for youth and energy.

‚ÄúThat is true‚Äù, another well-connected source said last night. ‚ÄúBut Buhari is looking for something more than age. He is desperate to redeem his legacy, especially in the wake of the raft of crises facing the country. You know the role of Buhari, his sacrifice and that of the Nigerian Army during the civil war.

‚ÄúRooting for Onu would be a masterstroke for the country‚Äôs unity at this time. It would repair Buhari‚Äôs damaged legacy, especially the accusations of nepotism against him. And increasingly, the thinking inside the Villa is that it is both fair and right to look to the South East.‚Äù

The source added that Onu, an engineer with a PhD in Chemical Engineering, has enjoyed a long-standing relationship with Buhari dating to their days, first in the All Nigerian Progressives Party (ANPP), under whose flag Buhari contested the 2003 election.

5/26/22, 8:53 PM - Chinedu Madu: *Sorrow May Last in the Night but Joy comes in the Morning*
_(Friday 27th May 2022. Read Acts 18:9-18, Ps.47:2-7, John 16:20-23)_ 

_*‚ÄúTruly, truly, I say to you, you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice; you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will turn into joy.‚Äù (John 16:20)*_

Jesus tells us today: ‚ÄúWhen a woman is in travail she has sorrow because her hour has come; but when she is delivered of the child, she no longer remembers the anguish, for joy that a child is born into the world. You have sorrow now, but I will see you again and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take your joy from you. On that day, you will ask nothing of me.‚Äù (John 16:20-23). 

What is there to ask for anymore when supernatural joy fills your heart? Nothing. In heaven, our hearts will lack nothing, our restlessness will cease, and we would become one with God. Our short time on earth is like the nine-month period of carrying a pregnancy. It could be tough at times but when we are successful in carrying it to the end, the joy we shall eventually experience shall be so much as to make up for the sorrow of this present life. 

However, Jesus does not say that there will be no moments of joy right here on earth. Rather, what he intends to say is that despite our righteousness and diligent obedience of his commandments, we cannot escape some dull moments. So long as we live on earth, we are constantly going to be oscillating between moments of joy and moments of sorrow. This was the experience of Paul in the first reading today. 

For a whole year and six months, Paul went about the city of Corinth preaching the Good News of salvation freely. God told him in a vision ‚ÄúDo not be afraid, but speak and do not be silent, for I am with you, and no man shall attack you to harm you.‚Äù It is not God‚Äôs will that we should live in perpetual misery simply because we do not belong to the world as Christians. No! God ensured that Paul enjoyed a time of joy while proclaiming the message. But this time was limited. 

Happiness on earth may be limited but the happiness above is totally unlimited. If we do not experience happiness as we so desire, let us not give up on God or attempt to seek happiness in sin. The devil cannot give what he does not have; it may seem as if we are enjoying for a while but soon it dawns on us that we have been deceived. Child of God, sorrow may last in the night but joy comes in the morning. Never Give up on God!

Let us pray: Lord Jesus, may I be fully prepared to receive the Holy Spirit. Amen.

*Be Happy. Live Positive. Have Faith. It is well with you. (Friday of the 6th week of Eastertide. Bible Study: Acts 18:9-18, Ps.47:2-7, John 16:20-23)*

5/28/22, 6:24 AM - Chinedu Madu: *Have Confidence in Prayer*
_(Saturday 28th May 2022. Read Acts 18:23-28, Ps. 47:2-3,8-10, John 16:23-28)_ 

_*‚ÄúTruly, truly, I say to you, if you ask anything of the Father, he will give it to you in my name.‚Äù (John 16:23)*_

It is one thing to pray but a different thing to have confidence in God. Think of this, almost everybody you know prays. If there is a church close to your house, they are probably at prayer right now. People have no problem praying but the real question is: ‚ÄúHow many of us believe in the power of prayers?‚Äù

In today‚Äôs Gospel passage, Jesus tells us: ‚ÄúIf you ask anything of the Father, he will give it to you in my name ‚Ä¶ ask and you will receive, that your joy may be complete.‚Äù The problem is, after asking, we refuse to drop our burdens completely with Jesus. We rise to our feet with heavy hearts as though we wasted our time praying. If prayer does not leave you joyful and happy, it means you haven‚Äôt prayed. Start all over again! 

If you do not believe that your prayers are capable of changing anything, then you are yet to understand the meaning of prayer. The deeper your confidence in the power and effectiveness of even a single line of the prayer, the more you see the result in your life. Make sure you reflect on every word you utter during prayer, know that whatever you say is heard by God; know that prayer really works, prayer changes things.

Our first reading today talks about a Jew named Apollos. He was an eloquent man well versed in the scriptures even though he was not properly catechized. Thanks to Priscilla and Aquila who took it upon themselves to teach him more. He was able to refute other Jews in public using the Scriptures. 

Apollos displayed a willingness to learn from Priscilla and Aquila and it paid off. Sometimes, when we are gifted, we could easily fall into the trap of pride, refusing to learn and refusing to grow. There is nothing as bad as being ignorant and yet arrogant. 

Let us pray: Lord Jesus, transform my prayer life so that I may remain forever joyful and peaceful. Amen.

*Be Happy. Live Positive. Have Faith. It is well with you. (Saturday of the 6th week of Eastertide. Bible Study: Acts 18:23-28, Ps. 47:2-3,8-10, John 16:23-28)*

5/29/22, 6:43 AM - +234 803 340 0059: No chance anywhere! LP doesn‚Äôt have the political structure, machinery, nor reach to win a presidential election in ‚ÄúNigeria‚Äù. No matter our wishful thinking. This is just the fact. 

I have come to see obi as being blindly selfish, with regards to his presidential ambition. He would have stayed in PDP, kept working dor the party (just like wike would), then fight/ lobby for the VP slot. At least, he would have been able to effect some of his policies we have come to love him for.
5/29/22, 6:51 AM - Sylvanus Oseghale: Which policy did VP osibanjo effect, which policy did Atiku affect under obj? Vp slot is useless, its even better to be senate president or speaker.

Secondly this mind set that nothing can happen outside apc or pdp is what will keep setting us back. It was the same thinking prior to 2015 that pdp could not lose or opposition can't defeat incumbent. If atiku is your candidate, vote him and stop trying to confuse us. I will vote whoever I think is the best candidate even if he is in apga or luccossa party.
5/29/22, 7:06 AM - +234 803 448 4689: @2347038529497 addressing the part that nothing can happen outside PDP and APC is a reality, take a cue from that of the US that has Republican and Democratic Party
5/29/22, 7:12 AM - +234 803 340 0059: 1) Atiku was very effective until obj made that office useless; we all witnessed this. Since this official power loss happened to him directly, there is ‚Äúhope‚Äù that he would return that power back to the VP chair, which would have given obi some room to work. He could have negotiated for this. 

2) it‚Äôs not imagining. It‚Äôs facts. At the time, Parties had to come together to form the APC, at the same time, many power blocks left the PDP to the same APC. There was a shift in political power from PDP to APC.  We all witnessed the build up of APC and what lead to it.  This is not the same case. 

It‚Äôs totally different from only one man ‚ÄúObi‚Äù going to a dead party in selfish hopes of victory because there are no strong contenders for his primaries there. 

Or it‚Äôs d online youths u expect to go and vote for him un masses, lolz. This ur polling unit so wen u Dey try do. If them shoot gun there u o remain? No be APC PDP get all those political thugs? Let‚Äôs be realistic baba.
5/29/22, 7:15 AM - Obose Eidusi: E b like u b Atiku follower lol
5/29/22, 7:18 AM - +234 803 340 0059: Not the point
5/29/22, 7:20 AM - +234 803 340 0059: WhT I‚Äôm saying is: 

The south needs to learn how to play regional politics and not party politics, then only will they be good contenders or opposition or even victorious. 

Now nobody is talking about how Obi may well be the answer in the absence of Obi! ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

If Obi had stayed in PDP, with the emergence of Atiku as the Presidential flag bearer, the position of the VP would have been guaranteed for him. He would have fought for it at least. Who knows what could happen if Atiku wins and they are both sworn in. Anything could happen and Obi could be the President. The Labour Party movement was rather premature and ill adviced.
5/29/22, 7:22 AM - Obose Eidusi: SM gave him that hope. Let's c how it plays out. Interesting months ahead

5/29/22, 7:35 AM - Sylvanus Oseghale: It's interesting, let's see how Apc gets out of their convention without been burnt. Nobody says obi is not in consultation with other stakeholders, wait until all the puzzles and cards have been dealt then we can begin to draw conclusions,

5/29/22, 10:58 AM - +234 803 340 0059: *COPIED MESSAGE* 

Unfortunately, the future will not be shaped by Kingsley Moghalu orator
If you like make Moghalu the President, Peter Obi the VP, Professor Charles Soludo the Economic Planning Minister and bring back Okonjo Iweala as Minister of Finance and Coordinator of the Economy, The Eastern Region Will remain underdevloped, Aba will remain abandoned. The Northern Nigeria Will remain backward and out of school children in the North will continue to grow astronomically and the Western Nigeria will continue to rotate like a berber's chair on the same spot.

*stupidity is doing the same thing and expecting a different result*

Once the premise is wrong, the conclusion will be always wrong.

Can anyone mention any other country where they have invested over $30 billion on electricity yet the megawatt remains less than 5,000 in 60 years?

In America when they had a strong President but a crazy man in person of Donald Trump as President, the strong American structure took care of him and pulled him out of the White house before he could damage the structure.

Go and ask OBJ, he is dazed till tomorrow that $16 billions invested in light generation produced more darkness.

Go and ask Jonathan, he is dazed that despite his good intention for Almajiris' education in the North, out of school children in the North remains the highest in the world per square kilometer!

Go and ask Buhari, how he became more clueless than the clueless Jonathan for the past 7 years.
 Buhari had 30 points agenda in 2015.

But he pushed Nigeria to become the world's poverty capital in 2019. This is the only trophy Buhari got for Nigeria in 7 years *Top to Bottom*
Does anyone think Buhari himself is happy at his *F9* parallel in his report sheet.
I don't think so. By the way Buhari's wife knows the truth and she is not happy that her husband scored perfect *F9*

The Nigeria elite is greedy. 
It is greed that is making them to purchase N100m form to run for presidency when they know deep within them that Nigeria is irredeemable as long as the existing superstructure is retained.

Nigeria is not your Anambra that Peter Obi's *Onitsha formula* can cure.

Nigeria is not BAT's Lagos either.

Question: What changes could Moghalu do as CBN deputy Governor?

What changes has Emefelie been able to do as CBN Governor aside from bringing *NAIRA VALUE FROM TOP TO BOTTOM*?

*Nigeria's two hands are tied by the British and Queen, the legs are tied by America and the West, the eyes are tied By Arabs and Middle East, the brain has been removed by China and the body is drugged by the the internal RENT COLLECTORS* who have hijacked the State.

Nigeria cannot get up from the bottom that Buhari and the past Presidents have pushed it to.

*Nigeria'si problem goes beyond bad leadership*

Bring Lee Kuan Yew or Mandela or Obama, they will all fail spectacularly.

Nigeria has to be unbundled, recalibrated, restrucured into Regions like the UK.

In the forest, Lions have their own colony. Ditto Elephant. Ditto leopard.

In the Ocean, Tilapia has her colony, ditto other fishes.

But in Nigeria, you lump everyone together in the same  bucket of water and you expect them to flow together at the same speed.

Little wonder why Nigeria's fishes are swallowing one another.

The fear of the unknown is the problem: the North thinks  she will die without the South workforce, water and Oil.

The East out of greed wants to Ride the *HORSE-* by all means when she has the capacity to build a bigger Horse - than the current Nigeria Horse; Ditto the West.

The *Nigeria Horse* is tired, weak and not configured to win any great trophy. 

The Horse that has been trophy-less in the past 60 years should be *sold* and be replaced with 3 or 4 or 6 or 8  new horses with fresh legs, eyes, minds and brains.

Employ Peter Obi or Soludo or Moghalu or Okonjo to ride the Eastern Horse.

Get Yemi Oshibanjo or Akinwumi to ride the Western Horse 

Emlpoy El Rufai or Ribadu to Ride the Northern Horse and allow them to compete for 15 years.

The result will be a More powerful, prosperous and respected Nigeria, stronger than Germany and Japan and UK.

I am 100% sure that Zamfra that has 1.5 million voters and 26 Children for WAEC will reverse the figures within 3 years because there will be no valid reason to breed children for election and keep them out of school inorder to easily manipulate them.

Leave Abuja with Army, and currency management. Don't Kill Nigeria. 

Big countries have their own usefulness.
Ask Israel and UAE: Both wish they had the Nigeria population!

All activities will take place in the Kaduna, Ibadan and Enugu under their Prime Minister.

The President in Abuja is like the Queen of England, no executive power except Military if Cameroon gendarmes want to trouble us.

In 15 years, the Northern region will be stronger than Thailand, the Western Region Will be stronger than South Korea and the Eastern Region will be ahead of Taiwan.

Please tell Moghalu I like his passion but he should use it to build a Pan Nigeria's Movement for *RESTRUCTURING* of the country before the 2023 elections.
At any rate, even if they don't listen to me, himself and Peter Obi cannot win the Presidency.
They should go and ask Chief Awololo how he became the best President Nigeria never had.

If it takes us another 60 years to accept this reality, nothing great can come out of Nigeria the way it is presently caliberated. 

I hear people say all Nigeria needs is *One strong leader*
Where is the leader coming from? From Mars?

IBB, OBJ, TY Danjuma, Buhari are all strong leaders but they all failed fantastically!

5/30/22, 3:23 PM - +234 809 464 9458: MY REACTION TO PDP PRIMARY ELECTION 2022.

In 2019, Wike supported Tambuwal heavily. But in 2022, Tambuwal stepped down for Atiku when he knows that Wike is contesting too. What does that tells you?

Fayose contested this PDP's primary and got ZERO (0) votes. Mind you, Ekiti had 16 delegates that voted. That means nobody voted for Fayose among Ekiti delegates.

Pius Anyim contested the primary too and got 14 votes. The delegates from SE were more than 90. How come the leading candidate from SE got 14? Who did others vote for? I thought we kind of 'agree' that SE must be given the ticket across all parties? Why are they not voting for their own aspirants from SE region?

Finally, Southern Delegates in general were there too, but voted for Atiku.

FLASH BACK .... before now ...

The South cried about marginalization ceaselessly.

The South screamed endlessly about Fulanization and Islamization.

Southerners with body language support for PDP due to their perceived APC 'misrule' and 'incompetence' of PMB called others in APC Fulani slaves.

NOW, COME BACK ...

Do you still believe in this cry for marginalization?

Do you truly believe there is Fulanization and Islamization agenda after our Southern delegates have voted for another Fulani.

Can we now call supporters of PDP a new set of Fulani slaves?

MY CONCLUSION ...

When next you hear the word marginalization, please note that it is due to fight over national cake and someone has been denied access to DOLLARS or NAIRA.

When next you hear FULANIZATION  and ISLAMIZATION agenda, know that it is a ruse. Politicians device it to divide the people to continue to rule over them in order to coverup their sins against the nation.

Friends, the politicians just succeeded in dividing us, especially we in the South, due to dollarization of primary election. This shows that people simply cry when dollar no reach them.

Wise up and take smart decision. If you fail, be ready to cry for another version of Fulanization and Islamization. If you say it is a lie, they know how to act out drama, kill people by disguising and hanging it on their perceived target to make you believe. 

It is so easy to manipulate you. They will write fearful propaganda messages and circulate it on WhatsApp and other social media platforms.

Again, beware of politicians.

5/31/22, 12:44 AM - Chinedu Madu: LOVE THOSE WHO HATE YOU

‚ÄúIf you were of the world, the world would love its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.‚Äù (John 15:19)

Is it possible to love someone who hates you? Yes. This is the challenge Jesus poses for us today. By the example of his own life, Jesus shows us that is possible to love and even die to redeem people that hate you. It was while we were enemies of God, that Jesus died on our behalf to show us that it is possible to love one‚Äôs enemies. (Cf. Romans 5:10)

Ordinarily, one would assume that if we love others as Jesus loved us, they would love us back but the shocking reality is that no matter how much love we give, we still get back hatred. Why does the world hate us so much? Jesus answers: ‚ÄúBecause you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own.‚Äù

Those who belong to the world operate by the principle ‚Äúsurvival of the fittest‚Äù which implies the destruction of the weak. For the worldly-minded, it is a sign of weakness to forgive or spare the life of one who poses a threat to you. This is why St. John and St. James warn us against being worldly-minded. (Cf. 1st John 2:15 & James 4:4). You cannot be worldly-minded and still try to love those who hate you. 

A lot of Christians today cannot accept the teaching of Jesus to love those who hate them because they basically operate by the standards of the worldly-minded. These are those who pray for the death of their haters and would readily take up arms to fight anyone perceived to be an enemy. 

In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus said: ‚ÄúYou have heard that it was said, ‚ÄòYou shall love your neighbour and hate your enemy.‚Äô  But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be children of your Father in heaven.‚Äù (Matthew 5:43-45). That is to say; our unique identity as Christians is that we are a people who love those who hate them. 

We are a mysterious people. We always forgive those who hurt us. We turn the other cheek when someone slaps us on one side. We let others have their way and we pray for God‚Äôs blessings rather than heap curses on our haters. (Cf. Matthew 5:38-39). This is how we melt the hearts of our enemies. This is the principle that has made our religion spread all over the world and continue to grow in leaps and bounds. 

We don‚Äôt believe in fighting on God‚Äôs behalf, we allow God to fight for himself and protect us while we do what He commanded ‚Äì we love everyone including our enemies; including those who insult us or threaten to kill us. Surely, this is hard but Jesus would not recommend it if it is entirely impossible to do. We can love our enemies if we choose to. It takes courage and self-sacrifice ‚Äì it is carrying the cross behind Jesus.

It was with this spirit of self-sacrifice that Paul went about carrying out his mission of evangelization to various towns and villages. Paul did not mind the challenges and persecutions he was facing. He was not discouraged because within his heart, he knew that he did not belong to this world and that even if he died, a better place lay ahead for him. 

Let us pray: Lord Jesus, teach me to love just as you loved. Amen.

Be Happy. Live Positive. Have Faith. It is well with you. (Saturday of the 5th week of Eastertide. Bible Study: Acts 16:1-10, Ps. 100:1-3,5, John 15:18-21)

5/31/22, 1:49 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: ADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY, MUHAMMADU BUHARI, PRESIDENT, FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA, TO THE PROGRESSIVE GOVERNORS‚Äô FORUM AT THE CONSULTATIVE MEETING HELD AT THE PRESIDENTIAL VILLA, ABUJA, ON TUESDAY, 31ST MAY, 2022
PROTOCOLS
	I am delighted to address this gathering of the Progressive  Governors‚Äô Forum  as part of the consultative processes that have always strengthened the internal dynamics of our Party, the All Progressives Congress, (APC).
2.	You will all recall that APC came to power at the center in 2015 through a cohesive machinery, notwithstanding its status as the opposition party. Similarly, in 2019, it was returned to power under my leadership, because of the dividends of democracy delivered to Nigerians irrespective of their political leanings.
3.	The Party has since grown in strength and capacity to govern.  The key to both electoral successes is the ability of the party to hold consultations and for its members to put the nation above other interests.
4.	The transition processes for the 2023 General Elections have commenced in earnest and I note that the most successful Political Parties globally have always relied on their internal cohesion and a strong leadership brand to achieve bigger electoral fortunes. Our party, the APC, shall not be any different, more so as we are still implementing the blueprint for a more prosperous nation.
5.	As I begin the final year of my second term as President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and leader of the Party, I recognize the compelling need for me to provide stronger leadership to the Party under this transition process and to ensure that it happens in an orderly manner.
6.	Such leadership is required so that the Party remains strong and united. It is also needed to improve our electoral fortunes by ensuring that it retains power at the center, hold the great majority  in various legislative chambers and also gain additional number of states at state levels. 

7.	 *In pursuit of the foregoing objectives, the Party has successfully established internal policies that promote continuity and smooth succession plans even at the state and local government levels. For example, first term Governors who have served credibly well have been encouraged to stand for re-election. Similarly, second term Governors have been accorded the privilege of promoting successors that are capable of driving their visions as well as the ideals of the party.*  
8.	In a few days, the Party will be holding its Convention during which primaries would take place to pick the Presidential Flag Bearer for the 2023 General Elections. This is a very significant process and its outcome should prove to the world, the positive quality of the APC regarding democratic principles, culture as well as leadership.
9.	As we approach the Convention, I appeal to all of you to allow our interests to converge, our focus to remain on the changing dynamics of our environment, the expectations of our citizens  and the global community. Our objective must be the victory of our party and our choice of candidate must be someone who would give the Nigerian masses a sense of victory  and confidence even before the elections.
10.	In keeping with the established internal policies of the Party and as we approach the Convention in a few days, therefore, I wish to solicit the reciprocity and support of the Governors and other stakeholders in picking my successor, who would fly the flag of our party for election into the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in 2023. 
11.	I wish to assure you that the consultation process shall continue to ensure that all aspirants and stakeholders would be brought on board right through to the convention. This would also ensure that any anxiety occasioned by different factors are effectively brought under control and that our party emerges stronger. 
12.	I thank you all for listening. God bless you all.  God bless our Party, the APC and God bless our nation, Nigeria.

6/1/22, 1:00 AM - Chinedu Madu: *How to Survive as Sheep among Wolves*
_(Wednesday 1st June 2022. Read Acts 20:28-38, Ps. 69-30,33-36, John 17:11-19)_ 

_*‚ÄúI have given them thy word; and the world has hated them because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. I do not pray that thou should take them out of the world, but that thou should keep them from the evil one.‚Äù (John 17:14-15)*_

The prayer of Jesus in today‚Äôs Gospel passage carries a lot of deep-seated messages. In fact, this prayer is both prophetic and instructive. Firstly, Jesus highlights the hatred of the world. St. Paul in today‚Äôs first reading mentions the fact that ‚Äúfierce wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock‚Ä¶‚Äù (Acts 20:29). It shouldn‚Äôt surprise you to know that there are many so determined to crush Christianity that they go to the extent of pretending to be members of the flock yet manifesting their hatred.

Secondly, Jesus does not pray that we should be taken away from the world but He prays for protection from the evil one. We wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers. (Ephesians 6:12). Nevertheless, we wrestle not as victims but as victors because as Jesus himself says, ‚ÄúI have overcome the world.‚Äù (John 16:33). The devil (the evil one) is real; we see all he does but God who is stronger protects us.

Thirdly, Jesus defines the Christian life as a missionary enterprise. ‚ÄúAs thou didst send me into the world, so I have sent them into the world.‚Äù (John 17:18) To be a Christian is to be on a mission: to preach the Gospel. We are not here to become successful as the world sees it. St. Paul in today‚Äôs first reading mentions the fact that during his stay, he did not covert anyone‚Äôs silver or gold or apparel but worked with his hands to meet his necessities. The love of money is the root of all evil. (1st Timothy 6:10). This is particularly true with regards to those of us (ministers) in the shoes of St. Paul today. 

Fourthly, Jesus says ‚Äúthey are not of the world even as I am not of the world.‚Äù This world is not our home. We are only passing through. We cannot have it all and we can‚Äôt expect everything to be perfect n this side of existence. We only need to be content and grateful. The book of Hebrews says: ‚ÄúBe content with what you have; for he has said, ‚ÄòI will never fail you nor forsake you.‚Äô Hence, we can confidently say, ‚ÄòThe Lord is my helper, I will not be afraid.‚Äô‚Äù (Hebrews 13:5-6)

Finally, Jesus prays that we should be sanctified in the truth. What is the truth? Jesus answers: ‚ÄúYour Word is Truth.‚Äù (John 17:17). Soak yourself daily in the Word of God.   

Let us pray: Come Holy Spirit and enkindle in us your Sacred Fire. Amen.

*Be Happy. Live Positive. Have Faith. It is well with you. (Saint Justin, Martyr. Bible Study: Acts 20:28-38, Ps. 69-30,33-36, John 17:11-19)*

6/2/22, 5:42 PM - Ogbole: They know too well that he is smarter than them
6/2/22, 5:48 PM - Ogbole: Decamp to another party, and test your popularity
6/2/22, 6:02 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Why should he, when he co-owns the APC
6/2/22, 6:04 PM - Ogbole: Lolllllllllllllllllllllllllll, this is very funny. If bubu singlehandedly picks a consensus candidate aside BAT, then BAT has lost his ownership
6/2/22, 6:06 PM - Ogbole: No ownership anywhere. The structure has been hijacked since
6/2/22, 6:06 PM - +234 809 464 9458: I thought üí≠ Apc is made up of 3 political parties so ü¶á can‚Äôt claim sole ownership
6/2/22, 6:07 PM - Ogbole: They have been deceiving him with the title of national leader
6/2/22, 6:07 PM - Ogbole: Bisi Akande is also a national leader
6/2/22, 6:08 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Co-own.... not sole ownership
6/2/22, 6:08 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Even Bisi reports to BAT
6/2/22, 6:08 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Na BAT put Bisi for there sef
6/2/22, 6:09 PM - +234 809 464 9458: So worse case if he‚Äôs denied then he moves with whatever part he thinks he owns aii
6/2/22, 6:09 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Yep... or remain to kick out the mofos
6/2/22, 6:10 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Tinubu isn't one to jump ship - he is the ship
6/2/22, 6:10 PM - Ogbole: What is currently the power distribution amongst AC, CPC and nPDP?
6/2/22, 6:11 PM - Ogbole: The 3 owners of apc
6/2/22, 6:11 PM - +234 809 464 9458: ANPP

6/2/22, 6:11 PM - Ogbole: ?
6/2/22, 6:12 PM - +234 809 464 9458: APC = AC/CPC/ANPP

6/2/22, 6:14 PM - Ogbole: This life sha
6/2/22, 6:14 PM - +234 809 464 9458: It was AC, CPC, ANPP and a faction of APGA that formed APC
6/2/22, 6:15 PM - Ogbole: Bubu and cabal wan bring out cane wey BAT and cabal take flog ambode
6/2/22, 6:16 PM - +234 809 464 9458: What goes around comes around
6/2/22, 6:17 PM - Ogbole: nPDP
6/2/22, 6:17 PM - Ogbole: Correct
6/2/22, 6:17 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: nPDP don die since
6/2/22, 6:18 PM - Ogbole: How?
6/2/22, 6:18 PM - Ogbole: Amaechi

6/2/22, 6:18 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: He get followers wey he carry enter APC?
6/2/22, 6:18 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: He is APC now
6/2/22, 6:18 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: nPDP doesn't have a faction in APC

6/2/22, 6:20 PM - Ogbole: Former Kwara state governor
6/2/22, 6:21 PM - Ogbole: If truly BAT nor get ticket, I wan see if governors loyal to him can break away
6/2/22, 6:21 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Lol
6/2/22, 6:21 PM - Ogbole: Gandollar, sanwolu and co
6/2/22, 6:21 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: They don't need to break away
6/2/22, 6:22 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: They'll just wrestle power back
6/2/22, 6:22 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Break go where nau?
6/2/22, 6:22 PM - Ogbole: How, Remain in the party and sell out?
6/2/22, 6:23 PM - +234 809 464 9458: If he doesn‚Äôt get the ticket then he would have lost his bargaining power‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ so people will pitch their tent where they ll benefit.
6/2/22, 6:23 PM - Ogbole: nAPC lolllllllllllllllllllllllllll
6/2/22, 6:25 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Naaaah....
6/2/22, 6:25 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Tinubu is close friends with Atiku
6/2/22, 6:26 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: He would use his south west leverage to threaten the APC aspirant
6/2/22, 6:27 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Even though he knows it would be a grave mistake to side with PDP, he would play an intense power play.
6/2/22, 6:27 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Be reminded that an APC presidential candidate isn't a president!
6/2/22, 6:27 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: The*
6/2/22, 6:27 PM - Ogbole: Omion, if he is not picked by the president, his leverage will become lever
6/2/22, 6:28 PM - Ogbole: South west nor go send an like that bro
6/2/22, 6:28 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Una really no know BAT then
6/2/22, 6:28 PM - Ogbole: Oyo is pdp
6/2/22, 6:29 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Lagos and Kano are the biggest states in Nigeria, population-wise
6/2/22, 6:29 PM - Frank Bello: Anyways ..all this na atiku gain
6/2/22, 6:29 PM - Ogbole: Adeleke defeated oyetola in osun before inec gave us another result
6/2/22, 6:29 PM - Frank Bello: Jagaban go rather support atiku
6/2/22, 6:29 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: If u think this is inconsequential, then u be political neophyte
6/2/22, 6:29 PM - Frank Bello: ?
6/2/22, 6:29 PM - Frank Bello: This is beer talk
6/2/22, 6:29 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Lolll

6/2/22, 6:32 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Same Tinubu wey play ball with PDP in 2011 to stop Buhari.
6/2/22, 6:33 PM - Ogbole: He is a mortal. If he doesn't get the ticket, then he should thread very softly and carefully

6/2/22, 6:38 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: See how he finish Saraki for messing with him in 2015
6/2/22, 6:39 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Literally kicked him out of the Senate and his party... used Oshio to pull all the hits!
6/2/22, 6:40 PM - Ogbole: Ok Omion, Bubu just spoke the mind of the cabal/northern elements when he addressed the progressive governors as regards supporting the aspirant picked by him. Don't be surprised that Gandollar and co currently following BAT all over are acting a script
6/2/22, 6:41 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: If you think Tinubu won't list conditions to Atiku if kicked out from the race, then your knowledge of the political maestro is non-existent
6/2/22, 6:42 PM - Ogbole: He had the support of the presidency
6/2/22, 6:42 PM - Ogbole: And the party
6/2/22, 6:42 PM - Ogbole: He didn't do it alone
6/2/22, 6:42 PM - Chidozie Iriogbele: Quite harsh. Remember KY gel is your friend.

6/2/22, 6:45 PM - Ogbole: This message was deleted
6/2/22, 6:55 PM - Ogbole: It won't get to this point. Tinubu's AD then supported OBJ's pdp cos there were trade off and some agreements before then, this made AD not to bring out any candidate for presidency then
6/2/22, 6:56 PM - Ogbole: "Leave AD to control SW, then we will vote for you as president"
6/2/22, 6:58 PM - Ogbole: Tinubu won't support an Atiku, when his party APC has a presidential candidate
6/2/22, 6:58 PM - Ogbole: Regards Omion
6/2/22, 7:02 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Lmaooooo
6/2/22, 7:02 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Regards omion.

6/2/22, 7:04 PM - Ogbole: This was the agreement
6/2/22, 7:05 PM - Ogbole: Leave south west for AD, then we won't feature any presidential candidate
6/2/22, 7:06 PM - Ogbole: But will support you and pdp at that level
6/2/22, 7:06 PM - Ogbole: They all lost to pdp in 2003 except lagos

6/3/22, 2:38 AM - Ogbole: What a sense of entitlement
6/3/22, 2:39 AM - Obose Eidusi: Because he already knows bubu isn't going to support him
6/3/22, 2:39 AM - +234 809 464 9458: Na the desperation dey set in

6/3/22, 2:42 AM - Ogbole: He really needs to be careful, make them nor collapse e political structure
6/3/22, 2:43 AM - Ogbole: He has made history already. A former Nadeco leader, A former Senator, A former Governor
6/3/22, 2:43 AM - Ogbole: A current kingmaker
6/3/22, 2:43 AM - Ogbole: Must he be a president?
6/3/22, 2:44 AM - Ogbole: Is it written in the Constitution, Bible or Quran, that he must be president?
6/3/22, 2:54 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Gbam
6/3/22, 2:55 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Na part of negotiation and persuasion. When u show a rival that you're no pushover, it gets them to rethink their strategy.
6/3/22, 2:56 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: I'll pick Atiku over Tinubu any day any time. I just think Tinubu has been unfairly treated by Buhari
6/3/22, 2:58 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Did u ask Buhari this question when he tried and failed 3 times, even after he was head of state in the 80s?
6/3/22, 2:58 AM - +234 809 464 9458: Buhari don make up e mind since and Tinubu don read the body language that na why he dey rant‚Ä¶.. should have started this reminder since

6/3/22, 2:59 AM - +234 803 448 4689: üòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑ he no bold ask oooo
6/3/22, 3:00 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: I guess he didn't want to rock the boat too early to avoid being seen as a troublemaker... so he decided to traverse the length and breath of the country, influencing delegates.
6/3/22, 3:07 AM - +234 809 464 9458: Only to find out that Buhari wan choose him successor as he BAT ü¶á has gone so far
6/3/22, 3:12 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Truth is, BAT already knew this. If u recall, Akeredolu published an op-ed where he openly stated his disagreement for zoning power to the North. Think this forced Bubu and co to focus on choosing a southern candidate. Now they've pulled a successor move as they've clearly experienced huge internal resistance.
6/3/22, 3:32 AM - Obose Eidusi: Tinubu fans now see osinbanjo as a failure ü§£ü§£
6/3/22, 3:33 AM - Obose Eidusi: Politics sha

6/3/22, 4:16 AM - Sylvanus Oseghale: He no get the power to do anything, we will judge him based on the times he acted as president and those few times he took very sound decisions
6/3/22, 4:17 AM - +44 7405 094706: Nothing wrong with tinubu statement and not one lie inside. However e fuck up to think because u put president e go loyal. You fit control governor but not a president

6/4/22, 2:23 PM - Solomon Aiwerioba: BREAKING: We'll axe Tinubu over comments against Buhari - APC chairman, Adamu - Daily Post Nigeria - https://dailypost.ng/2022/06/04/well-axe-tinubu-over-comments-against-buhari-apc-chairman-adamu/
6/4/22, 3:10 PM - Lazarus Owobu: Arrogance and pride precedes destruction, Tinubu can only lay claims and boast about APC's formation and her successes at winning and dislodging PDP from office to only people who don't know and participated in the merger processes which was conceived, started by Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu using ANPP whereof he was then the Party's Chairman.

I can say authoritatively that Tinubu and ACN as well Buhari and CPC were invited, wooed and begged to join the merger. HE John Odigie Oyegun, HE Mallam Ibrahim Shekarau and others were sent and led delegations to ACN and CPC(to come and join forces with ANPP) for the merger by ANPP under Dr Onu ; in the process HE Oyegun was persuaded by Tinubu(to defect and did defected to ACN) both thinking the merger will not work but Dr. Onu and all ANPP family's unity of purpose paid off other fractions of PDP and APGA joined. 

Immediately after the success and eventual winning the national elections HE Ahmed Tinubu started acclaiming the glory of the party's success to himself.

For those who didn't know the story of how APC won the elections and the architects of the success let me tell you briefly:
1. Formation of APC conceived, started, pioneered, sponsored by Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu. Without the merger of ANPP, CPC and ACN none of the party would have been able to defeat PDP but would have remained regional parties and PDP would have still be in power today. 

2. Credibility, integrity, wide acceptability and  impeccable character of HE Muhammadu Buhari which was taken into consideration by the party at giving the ticket to Buhari cannot be overemphasized as a factor for winning the elections. Take note that then they are three aspirants jostling for the APC ticket viz: HE Mallam Shekarau of ANPP, HE Muhammadu Buhari CPC and HE Bola Ahmed Tinubu ACN. With a lot of charges against Tinubu then it was obvious giving the ticket to him would have been counter productive

3.Dr. Onu was to be VP but conceded same to Tinubu but when the Muslim Muslim ticket issue came up and it was seen impracticable Tinubu was allowed to bring his candidate and invariably settled for Osibajo out of the 3 people he nominated.

4. Again Dr. Onu magnanimously conceded the post of National Leader of the party to Tinubu when he couldn't be VP, this issue created rift between HE Alimodu Sheriff and Dr Onu which would have scuttled the success of the merger process then.

5. The efforts of HE Mallam Shekarau should not be carpeted, he was busy all over the globe canvassing, addressing and attracting patronages from Nigerians in diaspora and international communities.

6.Again Dr. Onu further sacrificed and conceded the party's Chairman to Tinubu who gave same to Baba Akande.

7. The fact also of PDP's dismal performance, corruption, nepotism and arbitrariness culminating in the wanton destruction of the economy resulting the general rejection of PDP by Nigerians ; all these just to mention a few and many others are the factors and or reasons why APC won the elections.

You may say what about finance I can confirm to you that Tinubu contributed handsomely but others too did he was not the sole sponsor, resources were made available by the 3 major legacy parties ANPP, CPC & ACN by transfering their account's balances to APC, also huge contributions by the money bags in the names of HE Alimodu Sheriff, HE Okorocha, HE Shekarau, HE Rotimi Amaechi, HE Dr. Onu, HE Bukola Saraki etc made the elections easy for APC notwithstanding the PDP spending the resources of the nation for the elections and still failed having being in power for 16 years unbroken.

If it were to be for money alone PDP wouldn't have lost that election; so people saying it was Tinubu's money that got APC to power got it all wrong. For the 16 years of PDP's rule why did Tinubu and his regional party failed over and over to win election then?

In conclusion HE Bola Ahmed Tinubu's statement that " Muhammadu Buhari Would Not Have Become Nigeria's President Without Me..." arrogating to himself the honour of HE Muhammadu Buhari presidency and by extension APC's winning the elections without acknowledging the collective efforts and sacrifices of others is incorrect, uncharitable and unwarranted.

6/8/22, 3:34 PM - Osa Eweka: APC 2023!

Osinbajo did not even come 2nd! Amaechi also beat him.

Ijapa ni man yen. He should have stepped down yesterday when we were begging him and when the ovation was loudest, His Twitter and Facebook delegates deceived him and they went to hire people from Durumi to Eagle Square to be hailing him when Lagos delegates did not allow him to come down from his car. One of the said he will rather die than stepping down. 

Remember the moral folklore of the Tortoise that was going to the house of his mother in-law in another town and was asked when shall he return. The Tortoise answered and said "I don't know until I am disgraced". Now the Tortoise has now been disgraced. 

Osinbajo allowed Twitter and Facebook supporters who are not delegates to deceive him, this is a man that contested without a base, everyone including Religion Leaders and Traditional rulers from South West begged him to backtrack and allow his destiny helper and benefactor to (Asiwaju BolaAhmed Tinubu the Jagaban) "pass" but he refused and over-stressed the Grand Master using the name of God, and who will doubt it if a Pastor is droppingthe name of God? Alas we now know that he is moved by canal! 

Osinbajo failed to avert his mind to one of the Laws of Power "do not outshine your Master" and now committed political suicide! 

I pray and hope there can still be genuine reconciliation! 

I am TOLU BABALEYE ESQ writing from the Office of the Citizens!

6/10/22, 4:01 AM - Chinedu Madu: *To Lust is to Commit Adultery in Your Heart*
_(Friday 10th June 2022. Read 1 Kings 19:9,11-16, Ps. 27:7-9,13-14, Matthew 5:27-32)_ 

_*‚ÄúEveryone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.‚Äù (Matthew 5:28)*_

The contents of your heart determine the direction of your life. (Cf. Proverbs 4:23). Jesus taught us that it is not enough to say, ‚ÄúThou shall not kill‚Äù; killing a person begins with anger in your heart. As Jesus explains, whoever insults another is already committing a sin that is liable to hellfire. Of course, the best time to stop a fire is before it grows.

Just as we cannot afford to store anger in our hearts, Jesus warns against the sin of lust. For Jesus, looking lustfully is just as bad as adultery because by thinking about it, it is already happening in your mind. Hence, Jesus would say: ‚ÄúBlessed are the pure in heart‚Ä¶‚Äù (Matthew 5:8). Since there is nothing that we do without first thinking or planning for it in our hearts, Jesus teaches us that the battle against the flesh must be fought and conquered at the level of thoughts. As Jesus put it, ‚ÄúFor out of the heart come evil intentions, murder, adultery, fornication, theft, false witness, slander.‚Äù (Matthew 15:19).

Are you having trouble controlling your sexual appetite? Do you find yourself falling into the sin of adultery by thoughts, words, or actions? Are you struggling with fornication, masturbation, and unchastity in one form or another? Jesus has the solution for you: Start from the root - ‚ÄúIf your right eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away.‚Äù (Matthew 5:29). In other words, start by uprooting your bad thoughts and unholy desires. Do not leave any room for lustful wishes. When you look at a person, let their beauty remind you of the beauty and perfection of God. 

We cannot deny the fact that modern fashion today is particularly aimed at provoking lust in our hearts. As a child of God, select the kind of clothes you wear. In as much as God will judge a person for looking lustfully at you, God will also judge you for putting such clothes on your body. Jesus says: ‚ÄúTemptations to sin are sure to come, but woe to him by whom they come! It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were cast into the sea.‚Äù (Luke 17:1-2)

From this same passage of scripture, we can see that Jesus Christ does not support divorce. In fact, he ranks it as a sin equal to adultery itself. Jesus makes us understand God designed marriage to last forever. ‚ÄúFor this reason, a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh. So, they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man put asunder.‚Äù (Matthew 19:5-6)  

Let us pray: Lord God, you spoke to Elijah in a still small voice. Speak to my conscience daily and give me the power over my thoughts to keep my body pure and fitting as your temple. Through Christ our Lord. Amen.

*Be Happy. Live Positive. Have Faith. It is well with you. (Friday of week 10 in Ordinary Time. Bible Study: 1 Kings 19:9,11-16, Ps. 27:7-9,13-14, Matthew 5:27-32)*

I'm not afraid to bring on board people with higher wisdom because the most important thing to me is to get the job done for the betterment of all. I don't wait till zero hour to discover the next person to do the job or the next job to be done, from the first hour, I find them. The second, third and forth are as important as the first.... Time waits for nobody.... Even the obstacles on my way, I predict them before those that will bring them will start to think about them, I plan for betrayal, I plan for backstabbing, I also plan for reunion and forgiveness long before they happen. In life, I expect nothing, I expect anything, I expect everything.... "

6/13/22, 12:32 AM - Chinedu Madu: *An Eye for an Eye?*
_(Monday 13th June 2022. Read 1 Kings 21:1-16, Ps. 5:2-3,5-7, Matthew 5:38-42)_ 

_*‚ÄúIf any one strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also; and if anyone would sue you and take your coat, let him have your cloak as well!‚Äù (Matthew 5:39-40)*_

The strongest instinct in any living creature is survival. How then do we obey the words of Jesus in today‚Äôs Gospel passage? How do we restrain ourselves from resisting one who is evil? How do we turn the other cheek? How do we let our enemies take our cloak even after taking our coat? 

I think rather than ask ‚Äòhow‚Äô, we should be asking ‚Äòwhy.‚Äô If we all go by the principle of an eye for an eye, very soon we would all go blind. As much as we need to learn to let go and forgive, we should not forget that being imperfect creatures, we also stand in need of the forgiveness and mercy of others. 

In our first reading today, we see how Jezebel connived to put Naboth to death simply for refusing to sell his land to King Ahab. It wasn‚Äôt the case that Ahab was a poor man, he was the king, he was the richest man in the whole nation of Israel but due to his insatiable greed, he couldn‚Äôt take his eyes off the property of poor Naboth. Greed is a very serious disease. 

The cure for greed is charity. Learn to give things away so as not be worship these material things. Remind yourself that you brought nothing to this world and you shall go back with nothing. Be content with what you have and if you think your life will not be complete for not having this property or that, submit the matter to God. Ask, seek, knock. (Cf. Matthew 7:7)

Let us pray: Lord God, give me the grace to live above my natural instincts, to forgive, to let go, and to be generous through Christ our Lord. Amen.

*Be Happy. Live Positive. Have Faith. It is well with you. (Saint Antony of Padua, Priest, Doctor on Monday of week 11 in Ordinary Time. Bible Study: 1 Kings 21:1-16, Ps. 5:2-3,5-7, Matthew 5:38-42)*

(Share this post for all to be aware)!!!

Having spent two days visiting INEC office to update my PVC records and finally doing it, here are few observations which people aren't aware of:

1. Do not visit the INEC office if you want to ùóßùó•ùóîùó°ùó¶ùóôùóòùó• your Polling Unit. You can do it online and get it finalized.

2. You don't need to visit the INEC office if you wish to ùó®ùó£ùóóùóîùóßùóò your records, you can do it online.

3. If your card got ùóüùó¢ùó¶ùóß or ùóóùóîùó†ùóîùóöùóòùóó and needs ùó•ùóòùó£ùóüùóîùóñùóòùó†ùóòùó°ùóß, you can sort it out online. 

3. Only those who majorly need to visit the INEC office are ùó°ùóòùó™ ùó©ùó¢ùóßùóòùó•ùòÄ who hasn't been captured at all.

My experience was funny as INEC already approved and finalized my polling unit transfer request I did ONLINE since 2 weeks. All I had to do was wait for card collection to start and go collect.

But on getting to my turn on the INEC queue, I realized there was no need to come...lol. 

The guys doing the registration at the office were amazed at how I did everything online, even up to passport capturing

I had to then tell others and it helped reduced the population to a great extent

Enlightenment is key. Pls share this and tell others

PS: These tips will aid you avoid wasting Precious TIME and ENERGY queing up when you could've done these online. It doesn't mean you can't do these things In the INEC office.

Finally, get your PVC, transfer if necessary, and ensure to vote. Don't be indifferent.

6/14/22, 6:16 AM - Sylvanus Oseghale: Dear neighbours, greetings to you, all.

 Yesterday on our close, at about 11pm, the Vice  Chairman called my attention  to an ugly situation whereby  two adults male and female were seen walking around the estate completely naked. 

Our estate security and management personnel accosted them and accompanied them to our close (63) where the duo purportedly  reside in a BQ. 

As the case may be,  the situation soon got out of hand when both adults slit their writs and neck in what seemed to be a suicide attempts, saying  they will die and rise again in 3 days.

Further investigation of their BQ apartments revealed some items such as:  illegal drugs and other substances.

They were obviously under the influence of some substances (drug abuse).

Thank God for the swift response of our management, security and medical team  who eventually sedated  the victims and took them to the hospital around 12.45am.

Drug abuse is real! May God help our teens and let us be observant and to report anything that looks out of the ordinary within the neighborhood.

Cheers

6/14/22, 4:06 PM - Osa Eweka: BREAKING: Governor Nyesom Wike emerges Atiku Abubakar‚Äôs running mate.

Rivers State Governor Barr Nyesom Wike has defeated his Delta State Counterpart Governor Ifeanyi Okowa to emerge the running mate to the Presidential candidate of the People's Democratic Party (PDP) Alhaji Atiku Abubakar .

_A yet to be verified_ Sources at the National Headquarters of the People's Democratic Party (PDP) confirmed that the committee set up by the PDP to pick Atiku Abubakar‚Äôs running mate picked Rivers state governor, Nyesom Wike,  over Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State 
 
Governor Wike won by a whopping 16-3 votes and Governor Ifeanyi Okowa got only got 3 votes from the committee's votes.
 
It was gathered that the committee voted against the choice of Governor Okowa following the pressure by his former Political father James Ibori,  it was gathered that Ibori mounted a serious opposition and resistance to Atiku picking Okowa because his former political son Okowa hijacked the PDP delta state structure from him.
 
The Leadership of the People's Democratic Party (PDP) is expected to officially announce the choice of  the Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike  any moment.

6/17/22, 8:53 AM - Chidozie Iriogbele: Friends, I have joined the Obi train even though I have doubts that he can get 5m votes. I cannot vote APC and I don't see Atiku doing Nigeria any good.

I believe they are both out of touch with Nigerians and are both demagogues in thier own right.

Despite BAT's technocratic leanings, his politcal overeach is cancerous to Nigeria's health and growth. I also cannot in good conscience vote BAT who foisted Bubu on us.

We must as people seek change or the possibility of change. I will support PO for the chance it presents and the hope it enkindles in the hearts of Nigerians who yearn for better days.

It is my vote to "waste" and I pledge to not troll or insult any BAT or Atiku leaning voter. So help me God

6/19/22, 2:54 AM - Chinedu Madu: *The Eucharist: Nourishment for Our Souls*
_(Sunday 19th June 2022. Read Gen. 14:18-20, Ps. 110:1-4, 1 Cor. 11:23-26, Luke 9:11-17)_ 

_*‚ÄúAnd all ate and were satisfied.‚Äù (Luke 9:17)*_

Last Sunday, the central focus of our reflection was on the mystery of the Trinity. Today, our celebration centers on another central aspect of our Christian Faith; the Holy Eucharist ‚Äì Jesus‚Äô body and blood under the appearance of bread and wine. 

In today‚Äôs first reading, we see that bread and wine featured prominently in the blessing of Abram by Melchizedek, king of Salem and priest of God. Meanwhile, in our second reading, St. Paul provides a succinct catechism of the Holy Eucharist quoting Jesus‚Äô own words at the Last Supper. We see the divine mercy of Jesus displayed in today‚Äôs Gospel passage when he decided to feed the five thousand instead of sending them away hungry. No doubt, there are many lessons for us to learn today.

*1. The Holy Eucharist shows us the Depth of God‚Äôs Love for Us.*
In the feeding of the five thousand, one obvious lesson we learn is that we serve a God who is more interested in our physical as well as spiritual wellbeing. Jesus would not allow the crowds to go away hungry. He felt their plight and worked a miracle to feed them. This same feeling of love and concern is what inspired our Lord Jesus to sacrifice His own flesh and blood for us on our behalf. As St. Paul concludes in today‚Äôs second reading, ‚ÄúAs often we eat this bread and drink this chalice, we proclaim the Lord‚Äôs death. 

As Jesus noted, ‚ÄúGreater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends‚Äù (John 15:13). Holy Communion is deeper than just a ritual. Do not become too familiar with it that you fail to reflect on its inner meaning. Each time you approach the Holy Eucharist, bear in mind that you are encountering the purest love ever shown to mankind. In the Holy Eucharist, we come before a God who would stop at nothing to provide for the needs of His children even if it means shedding His own blood. There is no prayer that God would not answer when we present it as we receive Holy Communion.

*2. The Holy Eucharist Unites Us.*
In the miracle of the loaves, we would notice that Jesus instructs His disciples saying: ‚ÄúMake them sit down in companies, about fifty each.‚Äù This little detail carries a lot of meaning. The Eucharist is a meal that requires the bonding of hearts and minds together. When we partake of the Eucharist, we all eat and drink from one bread and one chalice. Keeping enmity with one another, fighting or backbiting should no longer exist in our community since we all share the same source of nourishment. 

Apart from sitting together in companies, Jesus used the occasion to teach us the importance of sharing what we have with others. The miracle of the loaves and fishes did not happen all of a sudden, it was a miracle that kept happening each time the bread and fish were broken and shared. Selfishness or self-centeredness are vices we must constantly eschew from our lives as Christians. The more we share the little we have, the more it increases. If we come to partake in the Eucharist, we must also go home to become ‚ÄúEucharist‚Äù to others by breaking and sharing our gifts, our resources, our time and all we have with others.

*3. The Eucharist is Tied to the Priesthood.*
Do you notice that without the priesthood, there is no Holy Eucharist and without the Holy Eucharist, there is no priesthood? In fact, it was right there at the Last Supper that the Priesthood began. When Jesus said to the twelve, ‚ÄúDo this in memory of me‚Äù He was basically giving them the power of the priesthood. The entire life of the priest revolves around the Holy Eucharist. Just as Melchizedek blessed Abram, the priest basically is ordained to bless the people.

We must avoid the temptation of looking down on our priests so as not to fall into the error of Jesus‚Äô close relatives who regarded Him simply as the carpenter‚Äôs son. Mark tells us that Jesus ‚Äúcould do no mighty work there, except that He laid His hands upon a few sick people and healed them. And He marvelled because of their unbelief‚Äù (Mark 6:5-6). Today, the priesthood is severely under attack, and the sins and mistakes of a few are blown out of proportion by the media. Satan‚Äôs real aim is to prevent mankind from the Holy Eucharist, the food of our souls, but he knows the only way to get to the Eucharist is by first destroying the priesthood. 

*4. The Eucharist is Food for our Souls.*
Our final lesson today comes from our Gospel acclamation. Here we hear Jesus say: ‚ÄúI am the living bread which came down from heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever‚Ä¶‚Äù (John 6:51). Are you a communicant? When last did you receive the Holy Eucharist worthily and in a state of grace? What is stopping you from taking Holy communion today?

If Jesus has given us His own flesh and blood, it is because He knows that as our bodies need food to survive, our souls also need the Eucharist to survive. The more we strive to receive Jesus in the Eucharist, the more we strive to live a sinless life and the more we receive Jesus, the more we become strengthened with more grace and power to be holier Christians. Do not stay away from communion, it is your ticket to eternal life.

Let us pray: Almighty ever-living God, deepen our appreciation and devotion to the Holy Eucharist. Through Christ our Lord. Amen.

*Be Happy. Live Positive. Have Faith. It is well with you. (Corpus Christi ‚Äì Solemnity. Bible Study: Gen. 14:18-20, Ps. 110:1-4, 1 Cor. 11:23-26, Luke 9:11-17)*

6/20/22, 2:24 PM - Brume Ikogho: "I am not sure you can rely on Nigerian registries for their veracity. But this is what the hacks have discovered. Allegedly, SABMiller owns the majority of shares (82.5 percent) and the State of Anambra 10 percent. The really interesting nugget of information concerns the so-called private investors. To all appearances it‚Äôs only one private investor, a company by the name of Next International, which ‚Äì I repeat ‚Äì allegedly has 7.5 percent of the shares. Guess who owns Next International? If Nigerian media are to be believed, it‚Äôs Governor Peter Obi of Anambra State and his family."

6/21/22, 3:43 PM - +234 803 340 0059: The Geography of Nigeria..... loaded with Intrigues and Sarcasm

A young northern shoemaker came to mend my slippers. I kept him with jokes and exchanged banters with him. He's from Kano. l asked who he would vote for in Kano, Ganduje?  His face changed to a scowl. Kwankwaso he said, with smiles. Of course I asked him why. He answered, "Ganduje is Fulani but Kwankwaso is Hausa". He completed without asking that Shekarau is Baro. What is the difference between Fulani and Hausa? l bet many of us don't know. We dwell and have our lives in a country whose basic geography we don't know or care less about.  

Yoruba erroneously call Edo persons ·ªçm·ªç ibo. Only a few know that Ilorin is culturally and linguistically Yoruba. ·π¢egun Adeniyi of ThisDay newspaper is Ilorin and despite the faked fulani accent of Bukola Saraki, he is a proper Yoruba boy when caught pants down. 

There are more muslims in Auchi and its surrounding towns than you would find in Ikare Akoko. But in certain riverine communities of Ondo, Delta and Rivers, many fifty year old persons have never seen a mosque in their entire life nor witnessed how Sallah is celebrated. Yet in Ebonyi State, there are Igbo muslim women completely covered in hijab, some even put in purdah. And there are numerous Igbo men who pray five times daily,  are Alhaji with four wives, also in Ebonyi. 

The security situation in Nigeria in the past 20 years has limited internal travel and by extension the  experiential education of a generation of Nigerians. Our locomotive of  prejudice is driven by ignorance. For instance, it's unbelievable to:many southerners, that there exist street  people and ordinary folks in Kaduna, Kano and Kastina who speak better English than most Lagosians. And that those three states offer more economic opportunities than most southern cities except perhaps Lagos. Maiduguri is not only the everlasting desire of Boko haram, but a city of beauty with a prestigious and beautiful university.  And there are more catholic churches and bigger cathedrals in Makurdi than you can find in Benin or Onitsha. 

There are 34 aspirants for the house of assembly in Adamawa, 16 out of the number are Christians. Out of 19 states politically zoned to the north, only Sokoto, Zamfara, Bauchi, Jigawa, Kano, Kastina can be completely referred to as politicaly Islamic. Kebbi and Gombe indigenuos northern   Deeper Life members would shock you in numbers, fervour and devotion. In Yakubu Dogara's village in Bauchi, the entire local government is almost 100% Christian. l bet you think l am writing lies. But I am not. We just don't bother to know this country enough.

Islam is not a religion in the north. It is a culture. A way of life. l am a Christian. But I am culturally Yoruba. Marriage, child naming funerals, inheritance and Will may be administered without my recourse to common law, church or even Bible. But the northern muslim knows no other way - of marriage, life, death or burial. His culture, tradition or custom is totally islamic, and regulated by the Quran and Hadiths of the prophet. He marries under shariah, and must be buried within 24 hours at death.  In fact, there is no customary court in muslim  northern Nigeria. None. Why should they have? Since there is no other customs to codify as law outside islamic norms and beliefs.  Therefore shariah court is a necessity and not a favour. Now you see why shariah is recognized and permitted under our 1999 Constitution. Thus, rearing of dogs or pigs is prohibited under law in northern Nigeria, alcohol consumption attracts sanctions, and Nigeria Police would arrest, persecute and jail you if you commit adultery with a married woman in Dutse or Daura. But adultery is not an offence under law in southern Nigeria, a.k.a Sodom. 

Friday/Jumat Prayer in northern Nigeria is also opportunity for community meeting, similar to southern Nigeria landlord association meeting. An Emir is not only a king, he is the defacto religious leader of the town or community. He's required to personally lead the worshippers at prayers, but he may conceed that to the imam if he so wishes. Cultural, traditional, social and economic issues are openly discussed at jumat. It's their form of bible study. Decisions reached are binding on the subjects, because in lslam, leadership opinion is seen, trusted and believed as an inspiration of Almighty Allah.  That's why the northern voter does not need to be given 5k before he could vote. He trusts the decision and wisdom of his emir and imam because Islam believes promotion comes from God.

Igbo are mercantile and competitive. Most do not live in large cities or urbanized political socialization like the Yoruba. They are acephalous individualistic persons, devoid of central headship or concentrated authority to stir thoughts or philosophy. Rather, the umunna, a family or clan centred body, headed by a system of controls involving men, women and youths operate the balance of power. It is the particular commune's interest that matters. Not that of the Nigerian or lgbo nation.That is why Ipob cannot be controlled, because Nnamdi Kanu does not answer to a central political system in Igboland. Compared to a Sunday Igboho who could be summoned, stopped, rebuked by Afenifere or the ·ªå·ªçni of Ife. Little wonder Ipob had to use force and deaths to coarse and get the buy- in to its vision. And that individuality of communes is why Enugu and Ebonyi have not joined the Ipob war in the east.

Akwa Ibom and Cross Rivers are a fused nation, and not ethnically Igbo as erroneously termed by Yoruba and Northerners. They live on the fringe of Nigeria, and had an economic island of their own until Godswill Akpabio and Donald Duke brought them to federal gaze. Both states share boundaries and ties with Cameroon. Uyo and Calabar parade some of the most beautiful and handsome beings in Nigeria, and are noted for out of this planet foods and cuisines.  Because of the contiguity of the states to northern Nigeria and shared life with the hausa tribes of Cameroon, the people have learnt to live peaceably with migrant herdsmen from upper Benue and Taraba. However, these southern cities are so far from western Nigeria, the Calabar man still sees Lagos as some London.

Southwest is a region of many universities, and cities of dashing young men in agbada and used 2012 C Class Mercedes Benz. The men are called Yoruba demons and there is a growing and booming whore trade that eclipses the market size of Benin and Benue. Yoruba is defiantly spoken, standard of English keeps falling, and the people still live economically and politically in the 60's. Ibadan folks don't believe Owerri is now richer, neater and more beautiful, and Akure thinks Abakaliki is the city of Obioma the tailor. But times and positions have changed. 

The Niger Delta is my favorite place in Nigeria. I feel safer there than any other region. Because, there are more private guns in the region than anywhere else in Nigeria. Have you ever heard that Fulani bandits or herdsmen killed or kidnapped someone in Ughelli, Warri, Yenagoa or Portharcourt? It's an abomination. ln the oil rich delta, only a dog is permitted to chop a dog. The region is a network of cities, creeks and towns connected with banga soup, starch and gin. Death is defeated in the delta, hence the people are never afraid to die. And it is the only known place in the world where the oyinbo man does not feel super or racist. An Urhobo photocopy boy would slap a Briton oil engineer over nothing, and an Ijaw technician could threaten to push an Italian driller overboard a rig. And heaven would refuse to fall.

Nigeria is a geographic drama.

6/22/22, 4:38 AM - Sylvanus Oseghale: This is comforting, sign of hope
6/22/22, 5:20 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: <Media omitted>
6/22/22, 5:20 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: This is how you win elections.
6/22/22, 5:20 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Make Obidients de there de make noise
6/22/22, 5:24 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: This is not how elections are won in other countries. In responsible climes elections are handled simply and not in a 'do or die' manner. These are 86 people from every corner of Nigeria coming to one state to 'win' an election when the incumbent ought to be using his own achievements to campaign.
6/22/22, 5:24 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: If the team campaigning are from Osun state alone I will understand.
6/22/22, 5:24 AM - Obose Eidusi: This is not oga. They did same in Edo and lost
6/22/22, 5:25 AM - +234 803 448 4689: Hmmm mmm, did you monitor the US election process leading to the elections proper???
6/22/22, 5:25 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: I meant state elections.
6/22/22, 5:25 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Osun state is a state election.
6/22/22, 5:26 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: I can imagine a state election in other countries.
6/22/22, 5:26 AM - +234 803 669 6995: In responsible climes...
6/22/22, 5:26 AM - +234 803 669 6995: Na 9ha be dis
6/22/22, 5:26 AM - +234 803 669 6995: Being OBIdient is electing Tinubu
6/22/22, 5:26 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: I don't think they will marshal 86 people to do such a thing.
6/22/22, 5:27 AM - +234 803 448 4689: Then go study election processes in the US statewide, start with Texas and California
6/22/22, 5:27 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Kindly educate me.
6/22/22, 5:27 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Did they bring out a list of 86 people to campaign for their parties?
6/22/22, 5:32 AM - +234 803 448 4689: Google is your friend Sir, note don't compare the developed world with Nigeria, remember the US is over 245yrs old, the UK is over 315yrs old
6/22/22, 5:33 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Story... they started late and Edo was difficult because the sitting governor was popular and moved to a popular party in the state.
6/22/22, 5:34 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: The initial claim says that this is how elections are won. I believe we can do better. A state election with an incumbent party that should have an advantage due to achievements does not need a council of 86 people for just one state.
6/22/22, 5:34 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: You ought to show me a similar list.
6/22/22, 5:34 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Then we can compare and contrast.
6/22/22, 5:34 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: You're stating things we already know bros. Naija no be UK.
6/22/22, 5:34 AM - +234 803 448 4689: Ok am coming, I will send you the list by 2027
6/22/22, 5:34 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Tell am abeg
6/22/22, 5:34 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: But you are in UK enjoying things being done in a proper way.
6/22/22, 5:35 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Why can't we aspire to do better?
6/22/22, 5:35 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Why make such a comment?
6/22/22, 5:35 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: We should inspire our selves to do better.
6/22/22, 5:35 AM - +234 803 448 4689: Do you know what they went thru to do things the proper way???
6/22/22, 5:35 AM - Obose Eidusi: Pdp in d state is very strong too and their candidate is very popular . He was robbed in 2018 remember
6/22/22, 5:35 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: What did they go through?
6/22/22, 5:36 AM - +234 803 448 4689: Google Sir, that's why I gave you the number of year's there have been in existence
6/22/22, 5:36 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: The structure makes sense. If na LP do am for a good governorship candidte, you would celebrate it. You shouldn't have a problem with the process. Na the people involved and the party nai be your problem.
6/22/22, 5:36 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: So do we wait for 200 plus years before we can aspire to do better?
6/22/22, 5:37 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Is that the logic here?
6/22/22, 5:37 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Hence the force and team they are pulling in to secure victory.
6/22/22, 5:39 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: You are the incumbent in government in the state. You are also in control of the structures at Federal level. You assemble an 86 man council including retired army officers into partisan political assignments. Is this how elections are won in UK?
6/22/22, 5:39 AM - +234 803 448 4689: If you want to wait so be it, ensure your comparisons are realistic as much as possible
6/22/22, 5:41 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: With this logic JFK shouldn't have imagined placing a man on the moon. Or waste precious time looking for cures to incurable diseases. Many journeys and projects usually start out as unrealistic and impossible.
6/22/22, 5:41 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Society doesn't always progress by betting only on a sure thing.
6/22/22, 5:41 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: This is how high-stake elections are done everywhere, especially when the opposition is solid.
6/22/22, 5:42 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Its as simple as that.
6/22/22, 5:43 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: I can understand President Buhari showing up during the election. I can also understand party structures being mobilized. Not 86 people. And not saying this is how it is won.
6/22/22, 5:43 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Na this puritan thinking nai de rob our people from seizing power from the current political class
6/22/22, 5:43 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: They an mobilize all these people and people will vote against them.
6/22/22, 5:43 AM - Chidozie Iriogbele: Whivh people ?
6/22/22, 5:43 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Can
6/22/22, 5:43 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: That's why you're not a political strategist.
6/22/22, 5:44 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Which puritan thinking?
6/22/22, 5:44 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: The current Obi-dients
6/22/22, 5:44 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Expecting things to be done in a logical way, without tailoring your strategy to the particular situation
6/22/22, 5:45 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: How long has this movement started? That it is often talked about shows that it is a valid movement. The issues raised are valid though. But it shouldn't be made to look as though the system cannot be disrupted.
6/22/22, 5:45 AM - Chidozie Iriogbele: Seriously what would you ha e them do ? Vote Atiku or Tinubu ?
6/22/22, 5:45 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: If the election was going to be easy, there won't be a need to have a big team to help win it for the incumbent
6/22/22, 5:45 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Sometimes a different strategy (outside the box) is the way to go.
6/22/22, 5:45 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: We are talking about Osun state election now my bro
6/22/22, 5:45 AM - Chidozie Iriogbele: Ok
6/22/22, 5:46 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: How many times this one don work for naija?
6/22/22, 5:46 AM - Sylvanus Oseghale: They rised up against tyranny from the likes of tinubu and corruption from the likes of atiku and not make excuses why good can't triumph
6/22/22, 5:46 AM - Chidozie Iriogbele: Make i comot mouth because i nor understand how anybody 40 and under fit openly support Atiku or Tinubu
6/22/22, 5:46 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: They did all this 4 years ago and still had to do 'Ogboju' to win. If after all this you still cheat then the 'strategy' by default should just be 'cheating'.
6/22/22, 5:46 AM - Sylvanus Oseghale: You Don work for naija ? üòÄ
6/22/22, 5:47 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Yes... simple ansa
6/22/22, 5:47 AM - Chidozie Iriogbele: No. Not ever
6/22/22, 5:47 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: The 'crowd' will not necessarily win the day if you still have to rely on cheating.
6/22/22, 5:47 AM - Sylvanus Oseghale: Abegi
6/22/22, 5:48 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Because them be pragmatists... them know se voting for Elizabeth Warren na waste of time when Trump and Bernie de same ballot paper.
6/22/22, 5:48 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: In 2007, during the 'do or die' election season PDP lost crucial states to people who mobilized, won their elections, were robbed and got their mandates back through the courts.
6/22/22, 5:48 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Yet he calls elections better than the naija workers... coz he sees things from an aerial view
6/22/22, 5:49 AM - Obose Eidusi: A man clearly did nothing for the state now wants to force himself for another 4 years
6/22/22, 5:49 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Remember that the first time out Bernie was an outlier and was even sounding ridiculous during the campaigns.
6/22/22, 5:49 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Gbam.... the party they lost to was a 'party' with structure and people.
6/22/22, 5:50 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: At the time the only state with AD or ACN was Lagos.
6/22/22, 5:50 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Peter Obi won the first APGA election without the traditional PDP structure.
6/22/22, 5:50 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Ut he was closely aligned to the Democratic party and voted under the Dems party, even though he is an independent
6/22/22, 5:50 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Mimiko won with LP without the normal structure and even went against OBJ.
6/22/22, 5:50 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: So the structure argument is not very valid here.
6/22/22, 5:51 AM - Sylvanus Oseghale: And that equates to tinubu and Atiku? You Don turn basket mouth ooo üòÄüòÄüòÄ
6/22/22, 5:52 AM - Sylvanus Oseghale: What are you willing to do yourself to make the change
6/22/22, 5:52 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: But our democracy was still quite new... and turbulence was easy to achieve due to the nascent nature of democracy. Not now that principalities and powers don de well rooted everywhere in the two big parties
6/22/22, 5:52 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Nothing
6/22/22, 5:52 AM - Sylvanus Oseghale: And here lies the problem
6/22/22, 5:52 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Then u really don't know how ans why he won
6/22/22, 5:52 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: See
6/22/22, 5:53 AM - Chidozie Iriogbele: Not remotely the same thing
6/22/22, 5:53 AM - Sylvanus Oseghale: He did nonetheless
6/22/22, 5:53 AM - Sylvanus Oseghale: Not even close
6/22/22, 5:53 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Until you guys get more involved in politicking and less into alutarism, una de make noise
6/22/22, 5:53 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: <Media omitted>
6/22/22, 5:54 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Una go end up throwing your votes away and getting more upset feel hopeless about the situation
6/22/22, 5:55 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: And una no go do anything to build momentum until 4 years time again
6/22/22, 5:55 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: And u wonder why una no de succeed in this clamour for a better nauja
6/22/22, 5:55 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Na now una de rush go collect PVC
6/22/22, 5:55 AM - Sylvanus Oseghale: Una üòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄ
6/22/22, 5:55 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: When all them APC don de mass mobilise to get PVC
6/22/22, 5:55 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Me I be labour party voter for UK
6/22/22, 5:56 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Na my country be this lol
6/22/22, 5:56 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Bro I have the details. I am just pointing out that the structure can be disrupted.
6/22/22, 5:56 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Naija, una no even serious
6/22/22, 5:56 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: U lie
6/22/22, 5:56 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Okay.
6/22/22, 5:57 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: I believe that as impossible as it may seem we have to keep hope alive.
6/22/22, 5:58 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: We have to believe that things can change. It is the only way out of the impending tipping point. I don't see these 'principalities' and their platforms making the drastic changes that need to be made.
6/22/22, 5:58 AM - Sylvanus Oseghale: <Media omitted>
6/22/22, 5:58 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: For example, the only way out of our mess financially is to drastically reduce cost/waste.
6/22/22, 5:58 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: I don't see how these people will agree to do that.
6/22/22, 5:58 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Will they agree to work for free this period?
6/22/22, 5:59 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Will their SAs, PAs, SSAs and others agree to work for the country with the barest minimum of remuneration?
6/22/22, 5:59 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Why didn't you keep it alive by mobilising men and women to get their PVC ready for a potentially good candidate in 2020? Why wait till now?
6/22/22, 5:59 AM - Sylvanus Oseghale: If we have a few who think like this there is hope. If a sitting governor can take note of the signs, and see that the momentum is shifting, then we are clearly doing something right
6/22/22, 6:00 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Check my FB page. I voted and campaigned for Atiku.
6/22/22, 6:00 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: In fact my criticism of Buhari was so loud that you guys severally made mention of it here. I mobilize everybody around me.
6/22/22, 6:00 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Ok... so what's wrong with him now?
6/22/22, 6:00 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: I have posted the process severally on this page.
6/22/22, 6:01 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: At the time he was the best candidate to support then.
6/22/22, 6:01 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: And believe me I have no issue against the man.
6/22/22, 6:01 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: I just wish he had raised political children to carry on this job with the bridges and structures he has raised over the years.
6/22/22, 6:01 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: So after he lost in 2019, you sat back and waited until 2022 to get folks mobilised again for a better candidate and u think 1 year will make the difference?
6/22/22, 6:02 AM - Obose Eidusi: Most of the people registering now may not even get pvc to vote so na waste of time . The north nor dey waste time like this even underage get pvc
6/22/22, 6:02 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Yes naaaaa
6/22/22, 6:02 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Na those underage wan vote Peter Obi?
6/22/22, 6:02 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: My problem with Sly and his crew is that they are lazy
6/22/22, 6:02 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: They just like a party ü•≥ üéâ...
6/22/22, 6:03 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: We have been sensitizing people on this since.
6/22/22, 6:03 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Na Mowu cree them be
6/22/22, 6:03 AM - +234 803 448 4689: Shifting cultivation, what happened to standing your ground and supporting your candidate all along, did he do anything within the past 4yrs to warrant a change of heart
6/22/22, 6:03 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Crew*
6/22/22, 6:03 AM - Obose Eidusi: Just watch out for Bornu, Bauchi, Adamawa , kano , jigawa and kaduna numbers
6/22/22, 6:04 AM - Obose Eidusi: Even plateau sef
6/22/22, 6:04 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: I'm upset that these Obidients failed to capitalise the momentum of Endsars into forming a political party.
6/22/22, 6:04 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Now they are rushing to get PVC one month before deadline
6/22/22, 6:04 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: And expect things to be well
6/22/22, 6:04 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: His stand on the Deborah Yakubu issue was very wrong. At a moment when the country was divided I expected him to have stood his ground against the northern religious establishment considering that even the Sultan had gone against that group in that matter.
6/22/22, 6:05 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Only this one nai make u no want Atiku again?
6/22/22, 6:05 AM - +234 803 448 4689: That's the incident that happened earlier this year right????
6/22/22, 6:05 AM - +234 803 448 4689: Pheeeeewwww
6/22/22, 6:06 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: The northern religious establishment is quite strong. If you kowtow to the mob now how do I know that you will not bow to them when another issue comes up?
6/22/22, 6:07 AM - Obose Eidusi: U know that releasing a statement and taking actions r 2 different things
6/22/22, 6:08 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Atiku made a comment condemning the mob killing of Deborah Yakubu, then deleted the tweet and made a retraction on his Hausa Twitter page explaining his reason for deleting the tweet IN HAUSA?
6/22/22, 6:08 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: You say that the tweet was 'unauthorized'.
6/22/22, 6:08 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Your own TWITTER page unauthorized.
6/22/22, 6:08 AM - Obose Eidusi: Sultan and d governor clearly made a statement but till today no deliberate action has taken place rather another one was killed in FCT
6/22/22, 6:09 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: In a country that is sharply divided as of today. If you cannot stand up to defend the rights of the northern political minority what makes you a valid candidate in a country with over 300 tribal groups with majority of them minorities.
6/22/22, 6:09 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Why should I trust you to defend my rights if you can bow to the northern religious establishment.
6/22/22, 6:10 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: The behaviour and indoctrination took decades to 'learn' and will take decades to unlearn.
6/22/22, 6:10 AM - +234 803 448 4689: I just taya
6/22/22, 6:10 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: When you make a clear statement against it you are sounding a note to the establishment that does the 'indoctrinating'.
6/22/22, 6:11 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: More voices condemning and taking action is actually required.
6/22/22, 6:16 AM - Sylvanus Oseghale: https://fb.watch/dOEcwIA9Jl/
6/22/22, 6:17 AM - Sylvanus Oseghale: He better pass you wey no mobilise yet criticise those wey ready do the little they can

6/22/22, 6:18 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: 2007 I participated in governorship and voted for Oshiomhole in Edo.
6/22/22, 6:18 AM - Sylvanus Oseghale: You complain about everything in this life since I know you, from football, to politics, to even church, take a side and sometimes do something guy
6/22/22, 6:18 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: 2011 I voted for GEJ and others in Warri here.

6/22/22, 6:19 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: I agree that it is shifting cultivation but at least I am participating.
6/22/22, 6:21 AM - Obose Eidusi: See this mumu I started talking about obi here before u

6/22/22, 6:28 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: U go weep
6/22/22, 6:28 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: It may look impossible but the way our country is we need a clear miracle.
6/22/22, 6:29 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Besides, I am not seeing Atiku sell his candidacy.
6/22/22, 6:29 AM - Obose Eidusi: Havevu asked urself why obi never get running mate from north cos many turn am down
6/22/22, 6:29 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: I expect him to tell us what he will do.
6/22/22, 6:29 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: <Media omitted>
6/22/22, 6:29 AM - +234 803 448 4689: ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ you wear sack cloth for the matter
6/22/22, 6:29 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: The last time he said he will sell NNPC and he was misconstrued as saying he will sell it to his friends.
6/22/22, 6:29 AM - Obose Eidusi: That kwankwaso talk na just vibe ü§£ü§£ü§£
6/22/22, 6:29 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: I expect to see his engageemnts.

6/22/22, 6:30 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Visit institutions like schools, churches, mosques, associations etc.
6/22/22, 6:30 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Tinubu is doing a bit of this.
6/22/22, 6:31 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Let us hear them speak and tell me how we can come out of the debt mess for example.
6/22/22, 6:31 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: <Media omitted>
6/22/22, 6:31 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Give me clear strategies on how you will contain BH, ISWAP, FHM and IPOB.
6/22/22, 6:31 AM - Obose Eidusi: Has obi said how he will do that
6/22/22, 6:31 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: How will you create jobs? What can I expect from you.
6/22/22, 6:32 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: His reaction to that question that I have seen is creation of employment.
6/22/22, 6:32 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: At least that is a response to that.
6/22/22, 6:32 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: PCP with its unknown candidate won because the party acronym resembles PDP. Thats the kind of electorate we are dealing with... yet Obidients de expect magic.
6/22/22, 6:33 AM - +234 803 448 4689: As usual, they will still finish ahead of Labour
6/22/22, 6:33 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: It will not be easy. In fact, the word impossible is the best word to describe it but it is possible if we try. Some great feats started out as dreams. Let Obidients dream.
6/22/22, 6:34 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: I don't think so.
6/22/22, 6:35 AM - Obose Eidusi: How does he get votes from d south west, NC, NE NW and part of SS have u asked urself this
6/22/22, 6:35 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Yeah... think Obi will finish a distant 3rd
6/22/22, 6:35 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Yes I have.
6/22/22, 6:36 AM - Obose Eidusi: Even SE some go still vote against am here
6/22/22, 6:36 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Yes I agree.
6/22/22, 6:36 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: The key issue here is the way our politics is heavily depended on 'money' for its outcomes.
6/22/22, 6:37 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: And not money for just campaigning like TV ads, rallies, etc.
6/22/22, 6:37 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Na the vote buying issue be the problem.
6/22/22, 6:37 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: This will take some time to change.
6/22/22, 6:37 AM - Obose Eidusi: And obi say e nor dey give shishi
6/22/22, 6:38 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: For example, the usual religious campaigning in the North is getting serious backlash right now.
6/22/22, 6:38 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: So if that can change then let us believe that other things can change but perhaps not immediately.
6/22/22, 6:38 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Lmao
6/22/22, 6:38 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Unfortunately yes. But I believe the way the country is, collecting 'shishi' makes you complicit. People are a little more enlightened now.
6/22/22, 6:39 AM - Obose Eidusi: Backlash from where lol
6/22/22, 6:39 AM - Sylvanus Oseghale: This is different bros

6/22/22, 6:40 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: So the likes of Sowore and Muoghalu that are supposedly good people yet Nigerians didn't even vote for them... u reckon Obi will be the magician here?
6/22/22, 6:41 AM - Sylvanus Oseghale: Has tinubu gotten a vp? Is he been turned down too? You too dey feel like say you know everything üòÄüòÄüòÄ
6/22/22, 6:41 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Look at the votes that APC and PDP got
6/22/22, 6:41 AM - Obose Eidusi: This movement would have made sense if it started after d 2019 election
6/22/22, 6:41 AM - Obose Eidusi: 8 months to election ? Common naw
6/22/22, 6:41 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: There is pushback now. Many of their religious clerics are feeling the heat and avoiding the normal partisan preaching. That is why Atiku should have stood by that statement so that the changes already happening will be gradually cemented.
6/22/22, 6:41 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: It's as simple as that
6/22/22, 6:41 AM - +234 803 448 4689: üëèüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩ

6/22/22, 6:43 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: As at 2019 he was VP to Atiku. Also remember that it took about a year for that issue to be resolved. Also remember that 2020/2021 was two years that COVID took from everybody.
6/22/22, 6:44 AM - Sylvanus Oseghale: Ok we have started the movement Now, join us let's see how fR we can go, somebody said if obi gets 5m votes that's a win for democracy, let's give it our best shot and if we get 8m votes and lose, we have a strong ground to push come 2027. Imagine say obi get 1m votes after all the movement, how people wan take get hope to dare when next there is a need?
6/22/22, 6:44 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: I wan see which major media station wan sell Obi give us 247
6/22/22, 6:44 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Even Tinubu/Atiku slowed down their campaigning for that period.
6/22/22, 6:44 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: I mean their election tribunal 'issue'.
6/22/22, 6:44 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: This will require funding and serious platforms.
6/22/22, 6:45 AM - Sylvanus Oseghale: Every month the noise will get louder bro, I assure you. Things dey on group well mapped out to loud this noise as the year runs down
6/22/22, 6:45 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Una no humble... na my problem be this... u guys are not wooing us properly.

6/22/22, 6:47 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Una know se na Atiku actually preside over the great economic boom we experienced between 1999 and 2007?
6/22/22, 6:47 AM - +234 803 448 4689: They just dey attack us anyhow
6/22/22, 6:47 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: He was in charge of the economy
6/22/22, 6:47 AM - Obose Eidusi: APC started theirs in 2013 , enough time before d 2015 elections but obedient think say 8 months go do d trick
6/22/22, 6:47 AM - +234 803 448 4689: üëèüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩ

6/22/22, 6:52 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: We are not voting in one man
6/22/22, 6:53 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: We are voting one man that has a team that can make the change we yearn for
6/22/22, 6:53 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: The team is as important as the man
6/22/22, 6:53 AM - Obose Eidusi: I think Atiku will do better
6/22/22, 6:54 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: As we speak, PO is North, SS, SE, SW. That's a huge risk
6/22/22, 6:54 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: The guys wey de at Ariku and Tinubu disposal can help make things move
6/22/22, 6:55 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Peter must strike deals with smellos and cabals in order to even have an attempt at getting 2million votes
6/22/22, 6:55 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: The guy no pure as una think
6/22/22, 6:55 AM - +234 803 448 4689: We no want local champion oooo, the way Daddy Bubu do us local with Fulani herdsmen

6/22/22, 7:57 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: I'm a firm believer of Keynsian economics. I believe we have to spend our way out of poverty, whilst also ensuring that our debts are refinanced and reduced over time. I think Peter Obi's mentality of saving savings saving will keep us poor and reduce growth!
6/22/22, 7:58 AM - Obose Eidusi: Yes I can
6/22/22, 7:59 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: So the spending includes some of the official waste we see or does Keynes not agree with cost minimalization?

6/22/22, 8:00 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: We have to spend of course. For example, resources are just never enough so we should prioritize. Cut costs here so that you can spend somewhere else. As PA to Atiku when he wins can our brother serve in a capacity that will help reduce cost so that we can spend Keynesially somewhere else?

6/23/22, 5:30 AM - +234 809 464 9458: J√ºrgen Klopp on the exit of Sadio Man√© to Bayern Munich.

"It‚Äôs a big moment. There is no point in anyone trying to pretend otherwise. One of Liverpool‚Äôs greatest ever players is leaving and we must acknowledge how significant this is.

‚ÄúHe leaves with our gratitude and our love. He leaves with his status among the greats guaranteed. And, yes, he leaves in a moment where he is one of the best players in world football.

‚ÄúBut we must not dwell on what we now lose, instead celebrate what we were privileged to have.

‚ÄúThe goals he scored, the trophies he won; a legend, for sure, but also a modern-day Liverpool icon.

‚ÄúSince he first stepped through the door, he made us better. If someone had told us in that moment what he would go on to contribute and achieve for this club, I‚Äôm not sure it would have been possible to comprehend in that moment. Not the scale of it at least. Sadio made it all possible.

‚ÄúTo be that good for such a sustained period and continuously improve season on season ‚Äì no matter how high he set his own bar in the previous one ‚Äì is an example to any player anywhere on the planet that professionalism and dedication leads to reward.

‚ÄúI respect completely his decision and I‚Äòm sure our supporters do also. If you love LFC, you have to love Sadio ‚Äì non-negotiable. It is possible to do this while accepting our loss is Bayern‚Äôs gain.

‚ÄúWe wish him nothing but success in every match he plays in, unless, of course, it's against us. His star will continue to rise, I have no doubts.

‚ÄúI remember last season I was asked, in an interview or Q&A from memory, to describe Sadio in three words. I said at the time it‚Äôs not possible to do this.

‚ÄúIf I was to try I‚Äôd need to be allowed multiple attempts ‚Äì because there are so many ways you can describe him using three words.

‚ÄúWorld-class player!

‚ÄúTrue club legend!

‚ÄúIdeal role model!

‚ÄúThe perfect teammate!

‚ÄúCompassionate, caring person!

‚ÄúBut the three words that feel the most appropriate today are also the hardest to say. ‚ÄòWill miss you!‚Äô‚Äù

6/23/22, 11:15 AM - +234 809 464 9458: When PEOPLE POWER is activated, STRUCTURES crumble. It happened in South Africa. It happened in Pakistan. It happened in France. It happened in Ukraine.

Volodomyr Zelensky, a lawyer and comedian, was a political outsider before he became Ukrainian president. His political party, Servant of the People, named after a TV series in which he played the role of Ukrainian President, was formed in 2018 with no structures anywhere except on social media where he was considered the frontrunner in opinion polls after he declared his intention to run for President in December 2018.

In 2019, he contested against political juggernaut, incumbent President Petro Poroshenko, and won with 73.23 percent. Not only that, but his party also won a landslide victory in the snap legislative election held shortly after his inauguration as president. What was his trump card? He positioned himself as an anti-establishment and anti-corruption figure, a hot selling point for a people already sick and tired of corruption in high places. 

Does that ring a bell? Nobody gave Zelensky, a comedian, a chance against the onslaught of Russia‚Äôs hard nut former KGB boss Vladimir Putin. He has led his people in the battle against Putin from the front, unlike some Generals, who would be bunker-bound at the threat of rag tag bandits.
Imran Khan, the renowned Pakistani cricket star had no significant political structure when he was voted Prime Minister in 2018. He rode to power on the populist approach that emphasizes the idea of juxtaposing the people against the elite.

Emmanuel Macron was a banker and civil servant before he became President. His only political experience was as a senior adviser to President Francois Hollande and later as Minister of the Economy, Industry and Digital Affairs between 2014 and 2016. In April 2016, he formed the En Marchel centrist political movement. 

By May 2017, he contested and was elected President, beating serial presidential contestant and seasoned politician, Marine Le Pen, with 66.1 percent of the vote. He was only 39 years old, which made him the youngest President in the history of France. 

A month later, in the June 2017 French legislative election, Macron‚Äôs party, renamed La R√©publique En Marche (LREM), secured a majority in the National Assembly. Those legislators belonged to the traditional parties with decades of structure. They saw the need to realign with progressive forces and did the needful. That is how rational human beings behave.

Now, the response of the naysayers to the above is quite predictable. They are going to say, ‚ÄòNigeria is different!‚Äô. Exactly! Nigeria is the poverty capital of the world, courtesy the same grandfathers that will not allow their children and grandchildren with modern ideas to lead. 

Those basing their 2023 permutations on stereotypical variables should hear this: What happened in Soweto in June 1976 happened at the Lekki Toll Gate in Lagos, Nigeria, in October 2020. Nigerian youths dared security forces and spoke in one voice, amplified by the social media, to say enough is enough to the mindless killing of youths on flimsy grounds.

#ENDSars was born! It reverberated around the world. It rekindled separatist agitations. It may not have achieved its purpose for various reasons. But it would be foolhardy to presume that #ENDSars is dead. We can already see its reincarnation in the OBIdient Movement.

The choice for the electorate in 2023 is not between Atiku, Tinubu and Obi. It is between continuing to live in bondage and making a fresh start. It is between disgruntled Nigerians and the hegemonic predators. It is between purveyors of the oppressive status quo and hitherto apathetic youths and students bent on taking the country back from the leaders of yesterday and today, using the people‚Äôs money to pave the way for them and their children and grandchildren to remain the leaders of tomorrow.

For those saying social media cannot elect a President, they are very correct. But at the same time, they are missing the point. It‚Äôs the people that will elect a President using social media to get people to register and change the perception of registered voters. Is that not happening already? That you are in PDP or APC does not mean you must vote for those parties. Party membership cards are not demanded at polling booths before the casting of ballots. Buhari rode partly on social media hype as MR INTEGRITY to Aso Rock in 2015. It was on social media the hooey that NEPA bill is better than PhD was sold and bought. Millions of votes cast for Buhari in 2015 by registered voters were not for the APC. They were for Buhari based on the perception created that he was the long-awaited messiah. They were protest votes against PDP and GEJ and their perceived 16 wasted years and cluelessness.

The unprecedented interest in who becomes Nigeria‚Äôs next President is symbolised by the OBIdient Movement. Whether it succeeds or fails in 2023 is not the issue. For sure, Nigeria is entering a new era of political activism. If Obi fails in 2023, it is Nigeria that will fail ‚Äì again! It is an unfathomable irony that Nigerians agree that there is a dire need for a redirection of the country but want to leave the reins in the hands of morally deficient operators who contributed actively to steering it into the present morass.

So, if you want Nigeria to win, help build the superstructure needed for the victory. Talk to your friends, neighbours and family members. Let them know the absurdity in taking money from politicians to make their children and grandchildren slaves to the politicians‚Äô children and grandchildren. Nigeria is made up of families, not political structures!

6/24/22, 2:08 AM - Chinedu Madu: *The Sacred Heart of Jesus: A Heart of a True Shepherd*
_(Friday 24th June 2022. Read Ezekiel 34:11-16, Ps. 23, Romans 5:5-11, Luke 15:3-7)_ 

_*‚ÄúThere will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance.‚Äù (Luke 15:7)*_

As we know, the word ‚Äúheart‚Äù can be used either literally or figuratively. In its literal sense, the heart refers to a physical organ in the body that is responsible for pumping and distributing blood across the body. Blood provides the body with oxygen and nutrients, and also assists in the removal of metabolic wastes. The function of the heart is so central and so important that it can be said to be the single most important organ in the human body. It is to a human being what an engine is to a vehicle. 

Given the ultimate importance of the heart physically, the word ‚Äòheart‚Äô is often used figuratively to refer to essence of a person; the inner being. From the language of scripture, we can decipher that there are different types of hearts. For instance, in Ezekiel 36:26 we read: ‚ÄúA new heart I will give you, and a new spirit I will put within you; and I will take out of your flesh the heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.‚Äù Of course, Jesus‚Äô heart was not a heart of stone.

Today we celebrate the Sacred Heart of Jesus. We celebrate that which propelled Jesus to become man and save us like a shepherd who sacrifices everything to rescue a lost sheep leaving the ninety-nine behind (Luke 15:4). We celebrate that which moved Jesus to love us so much to the point of dying on the cross on our behalf not considering the fact that we did not even deserve it. As St. Paul says in our second reading today. ‚ÄúGod shows his love for us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us‚Äù (Romans 5:8).  

The heart of Jesus is first sacred because it is the heart of God. It is also a typical shepherd‚Äôs heart, a heart so full of love and concern for the good of humanity who are His Sheep. From this heart, we hear God speaking through the prophet Ezekiel in today‚Äôs first reading: ‚ÄúI seek out my sheep; and I will rescue them from all places where they have been scattered... And I will bring them out from the peoples, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them into their own land; and I will feed them on the mountains‚Ä¶ I will feed them with good pasture, ‚Ä¶ they shall lie down in good grazing land, and on fat pasture, they shall feed‚Äù (Ezekiel 34:12-14). This is exactly what God desires for us His children.

The Sacred Heart of Jesus represents true love for us. In our devotion to the Sacred heart, our prayer is that God may make our hearts like the heart of Jesus.

Let us pray: Most Sacred Heart of Jesus, Have Mercy on us, Amen.

*Be Happy. Live Positive. Have Faith. It is well with you. (The Most Sacred Heart of Jesus ‚Äì Solemnity. Bible Study: Ezekiel 34:11-16, Ps. 23, Romans 5:5-11, Luke 15:3-7)*

6/25/22, 4:57 AM - Chinedu Madu: *Mary‚Äôs Immaculate Heart.*
_(Saturday 25th June 2022. Read Lamentations 2:2,10-14,18-19, Ps. 73:1-7,20-21, Luke 2:41-51)_ 

_*‚ÄúHe went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was obedient to them, and his mother kept all these things in her heart.‚Äù (Luke 2:51)*_

Yesterday, we celebrated the Sacred Heart of Jesus, today we are celebrating the Immaculate Heart of Mary, the Mother of Jesus Christ. What are the characteristics of her heart?

1. Humility. Mary was never proud. Mary acknowledged she was just a handmaid of God and she never went about seeking praise and exultation from her fellow women like the Pharisees who loved to be greeted obsequiously in the marketplaces.

2. Silence. As we see in today‚Äôs Gospel passage, Mary treasured everything in her heart. She practised the act of Contemplative Prayer which some saints have described as the most perfect form of prayer. In contemplation, we do not use words but simply centre ourselves in the presence of God pondering in our hearts what he says to us. 

3. Righteousness. Mary had a PURE heart. It is as a result of Mary‚Äôs outstanding sinlessness that we refer to her heart as IMMACULATE. It was this purity of heart that made God so fall in love with her as to choose her to be his mother. In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus gave us a secret; ‚ÄúBlessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.‚Äù (Matthew 5:8). Only a heart so pure can contain God as Mary did. 

As we reflect on Mary‚Äôs Immaculate Heart, let us look at our own hearts. Is my heart like that of Mary? What efforts am I making to guard my heart against all defilements of evil? Is my heart clean enough to accommodate God? Am I willing to listen to the truth and change my ways? 

Let us pray: Almighty ever-living Father, cleanse my heart from all impurity and sinfulness. Through Christ our Lord. Amen.

*Be Happy. Live Positive. Have Faith. It is well with you. (The Immaculate Heart of Mary. Bible Study: Lamentations 2:2,10-14,18-19, Ps. 73:1-7,20-21, Luke 2:41-51)*

6/25/22, 5:59 PM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Dr Strangetweet or How I Learned to Love 

You don‚Äôt like the decisions yesterday and today?

You‚Äôre really not going to like the next part.

I mean, it‚Äôs your fault, but you‚Äôre not going to like it. 
See, we were cool with the status quo.

Yeah, we wanted abortion to go back to the states. Yeah, we wanted gun rights expanded. Yeah, we wanted our kids safe from LGBTQ indoctrination.

But it wasn‚Äôt enough to fight about. 
We thought you were like us, that we could argue and make small gains and lose some ground but everything staying fairly level and levelheaded.

But boy, were we wrong.

Because while we were copacetic and just going along to get along, you were pushing. 
You pushed abortion. From ‚Äúlegal, safe, and rare in these specific instances‚Äù, you pushed now to the point of post birth abortion on demand for any reason. 
You pushed gun control. From ‚Äúbackground checks and gun free zones‚Äù to now ‚Äúred flag laws‚Äù which deny due process. 
You pushed ‚Äúthe rights of gay marriage‚Äù to now the ‚Äúright of LGBTQ teachers telling kindergarteners about their sex life.‚Äù 
And during all of this, you pushed disagreeing politically to calling us Nazis and justifying violence against us, justifying harming our families and our jobs. 
So now, we push back.

We pushed back with Trump.
We pushed back with state legislators.
We pushed back with school boards.

And we haven‚Äôt even begun to push back, kiddo. 
We‚Äôre going to push abortion back to the ‚Äúrare‚Äù side in many states.

We may give you a timeframe like 12 to 15 weeks, about what your beloved ‚Äúother industrialized nations‚Äù give.

We may not. 
We‚Äôre going to push back on gun control.

We‚Äôre not going to accept your offer of ‚Äúyou can keep some guns until we decide to get rid of them.‚Äù

We‚Äôre going to elect legislators to make ownership easier. We‚Äôre claiming our rights back. 
We‚Äôre going to push back on the LGBTQ agenda.

We‚Äôre going to make your lives miserable when you try to get our kids to question their gender.

We‚Äôre going to remove the power you think you have and put it in the hands of the parents. 
You had a chance to call a truce.
You had a chance to be in control and be happy.
You had a chance to just leave us alone.

You didn‚Äôt. 
You pushed and prodded and provoked.

And you‚Äôre threatening to commit violence now?

Good luck with that. 
There‚Äôs a saying about the danger of making people who want to be left alone get involved.

You‚Äôve made us get involved.

So all of it, from here on out, is squarely on you.

Enjoy the whirlwind you have so deservedly reaped.

6/26/22, 3:25 AM - +234 803 340 0059: It‚Äôs not only for obi‚Äôs voters to be eligible to vote. It‚Äôs also about his followers being able to actually vote on Election Day, ensuring their vote counts in all the various polling units. These require structure, man power, financing, etc.
6/26/22, 3:25 AM - +234 803 669 6995: The best Obi woukd do is whittle down PDP vote
6/26/22, 3:26 AM - +234 803 448 4689: You haven't apologised yet for being "sentimental"
6/26/22, 3:26 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: U really underestimate the tribalistic nature of ibos

6/26/22, 3:27 AM - +234 803 669 6995: And Obi vice is a southern Christian who has no clout in his LGA
6/26/22, 3:27 AM - +234 809 464 9458: Election dey come‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ make we wait
6/26/22, 3:27 AM - +234 803 669 6995: Obi wont win

6/26/22, 3:28 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Fact
6/26/22, 3:29 AM - Sylvanus Oseghale: Everything depends on who Obi gets as VP..... wait until that happens
6/26/22, 3:29 AM - +234 809 464 9458: Yeah but i m waiting to see how Nigerians vote üó≥ also very optimistic
6/26/22, 3:29 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: VPs have never been the decided factor.... NEVER!!!
6/26/22, 3:30 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Yeah.... I feel u.
6/26/22, 3:30 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: It will be exciting.... but thr anticlimax will be hugeeeeee!!!!
6/26/22, 3:31 AM - +234 803 340 0059: Na only for highly urban areas Obi vote go really count. The remaining places his voters wouldn‚Äôt stand a chance
6/26/22, 3:36 AM - +234 803 448 4689: Because he will have no voters
6/26/22, 3:40 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Truth is, for Non-Obi supporters like me, the 2023 election will be a win-win.... if Pitobi gets very high votes but doesnt win, that would be fantastic to see, as it would represent a hughe middle-finger to the establishment.
6/26/22, 3:40 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Huge*
6/26/22, 3:41 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Na buffet election for us

6/26/22, 3:53 AM - Sylvanus Oseghale: The bigger the vote percentage of PO the less Atiku's chances
6/26/22, 3:54 AM - Obose Eidusi: Atiku is taking d north . Nothing will stop that
6/26/22, 3:54 AM - +234 809 464 9458: Yeah
6/26/22, 4:08 AM - Sylvanus Oseghale: Obi doesn't have to win the north,  he just needs 1/4 of that vote
6/26/22, 4:09 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Northern cabal delivered to Buhari in 2015... which northern cabal wan give power to Ojukwu people in 2023?
6/26/22, 4:09 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Coz landslide is guaranteed in the South for him abi?
6/26/22, 4:09 AM - Sylvanus Oseghale: Let atiku take a little less than half and BAT takes a little more than 1/4
6/26/22, 4:10 AM - Sylvanus Oseghale: We will be ok with 3rd in the north as long as we aren't too far behind....
6/26/22, 4:11 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Hehehehe... na 230 votes una go gain for north
6/26/22, 4:13 AM - +234 803 340 0059: Not necessarily. If u remember clearly. There was a mass exodus of political big wits from PDP and d rest to form the APC. This restructuring and realignment of the APC then, was what really boosted their eligibility to take power. PDP as at then, although incumbent, was a sinking ship!
6/26/22, 4:24 AM - Sylvanus Oseghale: I agree obi needs a miracle to win the election, I'm hopeful one is coming
6/26/22, 4:26 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Have u spared a thought on the unintended consequences of having an Obi Presidency?
6/26/22, 4:27 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: And all the things that could possibly go wrong?
6/26/22, 4:27 AM - Obose Eidusi: Politicians don dey silently decamp for north
6/26/22, 4:27 AM - Obose Eidusi: No noise about it
6/26/22, 4:27 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Or u just think se Obi na magician?
6/26/22, 4:27 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: None de go LP sha
6/26/22, 4:28 AM - Obose Eidusi: LP for north ü§£ü§£ü§£
6/26/22, 4:30 AM - Obose Eidusi: Help me ask am
6/26/22, 4:31 AM - Sylvanus Oseghale: We no need magician to fix Nigeria, all we need is someone who will punish wrong doers dats all.... I'm not sure that's too much to ask
6/26/22, 4:31 AM - +234 803 340 0059: One man alone (especially a man like Obi) can‚Äôt do shit. He would end up creating more problems than solving them (despite his good intentions and policies). 

He doesn‚Äôt have the persona of a dictator. For him alone to go against the system , he would need to b more like wike with his stance on issues.
6/26/22, 4:32 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Lol... Punish wrongdoers??????? Does Obi have a track record for this? Man wey don already de show huge solidarity with Ekweremadu, even before the facts have been established?
6/26/22, 4:32 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Not sure you have thought this through my bro
6/26/22, 4:34 AM - +234 803 340 0059: U r aware he was impeached 3 times as governor. He wouldn‚Äôt even last 3 months against the in coming Senators. He has to align himself for him to make effective changes to the system.
6/26/22, 4:34 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: This is the very reason why I'm not supportive of his ambitions for now. Him structure and the country's setup aren't there yet for a successful Obi government... we need some dysfunctional stability from Bubu disaster first, before we start to reason purist governance from the likes of Obi
6/26/22, 4:35 AM - +234 803 340 0059: ‚úîÔ∏è
6/26/22, 4:36 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Impeached because he didn't play ball with state politicians wey be fellow ibos.... for national level, the principalities and powers are stronger and more united in their vested interests.... Naija may burn üî•in no time if Obi wins!
6/26/22, 4:36 AM - +234 803 340 0059: This is my real fear!
6/26/22, 4:37 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: And its a valid one
6/26/22, 4:38 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: See how North use Boko take mess GEJ up... till now them never fit quence that fire

6/26/22, 4:43 AM - Sylvanus Oseghale: Does ekweremadu not have the right to innocence until proven guilty.?

Did atiku not delete ordinary tweet when murderers killed an innocent girl some months back? Which is worse. Baba abegi
6/26/22, 4:43 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Naija is no different.... we need strongmen wey sabi deliver prosperity. The two characteristics are inseparable and COMPULSORY if u want a successful Nigerian president.
6/26/22, 4:44 AM - Sylvanus Oseghale: What you don't know is that the pdp will see obi as their own just as they did when tinubu wanted to make gbajabiamila speaker in 2015...
6/26/22, 4:45 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Please go back and read Obis statement... could have been worded better.... (I stand by the Ekweremadus)

6/27/22, 3:39 AM - Chinedu Madu: *Never forget the Cries of the Poor*
_(Monday 27th June 2022. Read Amos 2:6-10,13-16, Ps. 50:16-23, Matthew 8:18-22)_ 

_*‚ÄúFoxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man has nowhere to lay his head.‚Äù (Matthew 8:20)*_

In a capitalist society like ours where money has become the god of many, human beings are bought, sold, and exchanged like slaves. I saw a viral video of a lady paid to be a dog. There now exists the business of harvesting and sale of human organs and many are lured into it by persons promising to give them a better life abroad. Human life has become reduced to a pair of sandals. Just as it happened in the time of Amos, it is happening before our eyes.

When last did you consciously decide to seek out the poorest of the poor in your community or around your neighbourhood? Do you consider the poor as a nuisance; a disturbance or just dirt that needs to be taken out of your sight? Think twice. As long as someone is going to bed without food this night in your area, you are not safe.

In today‚Äôs Gospel passage, Jesus is not ashamed to be associated with poverty. To the scribe who opted to follow him, Jesus said: ‚ÄúFoxes have holes, birds have nests but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.‚Äù It was necessary for Jesus to explain to the scribe the level of difficulty involved in ministry and the absolute necessity of detachment from the things of this world.

Jesus lived his entire life on earth as a poor man. He was born in a manger and buried in a borrowed tomb. He was so hungry one time that He and His disciples had to go into a corn field to pluck heads of grain and eat even though it was a Sabbath. Jesus was often invited to dine in the homes of the rich but He never sought to enrich himself. 

For instance, in the case of Zacchaeus, Jesus did not demand tithe from him but made Zacchaeus repent from the business of defrauding others. Meanwhile, in the case of Matthew, Jesus turned him into one of his disciples. It was while in the house of a Pharisee that Jesus‚Äô feet were anointed with an expensive ointment by a woman who didn‚Äôt have a good reputation in town. Jesus went to the home of Jairus, a ruler of the synagogue, and raised his daughter to life yet in all of these, Jesus did not have a place to lay his head. 

As a minister, there would be countless opportunities of meeting with the creme de la creme of society. As a minister, it is very easy to have best friends from among the rich and powerful and the temptation is there to forget that we are meant to bridge the gap between the rich and poor in society. Like a blocked pipe, some of us collect but fail to allow it to flow to the poor. Some even go as far as displaying material wealth as if they were in some sort of competition with each other which is not right at all.

Let us pray: Almighty ever-living Father, give me a heart that is soft enough to remember those who cannot afford what I waste daily. Through Christ our Lord. Amen.

*Be Happy. Live Positive. Have Faith. It is well with you. (Monday of week 13 in Ordinary Time. Bible Study: Amos 2:6-10,13-16, Ps. 50:16-23, Matthew 8:18-22)*

6/28/22, 3:37 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: What manner of a Nigerian is this Peter Obi?

The insolence of Peter Obi against the North and Northerners part (1): A personal Account or a community's travails in the hand of a Tribal bigot as chief executive. 

By AG Mahmoud 25th June 2022

Nigeria is indeed in the process of another election cycle which is usually termed "political season" in local parlance. It always comes and goes, but each election cycle comes with its own  unique rhetoric mostly based on ethnic, religious, and zoning considerations. 
And 2023 elections would not be an exception. Interestingly, in addition to these  factors, there is a radical shift from party politics to politics of personality which portends a welcome development in Nigeria's yearning for better and more inclusive leadership at the centre. This quest emanated from Southerners and Northerners alike leading to the emergence two prominent figures namely: Dr Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso and Mr Peter Obi. Both of them are believed in some quarters to be eminently competent and qualified to steer the leadership of Nigeria if elected but this write-up is on Peter Obi. 
 
I could remember Peter Obi came to power on 17th March 2006 while the famous Onitsha crisis which led to the killings of Northerners occurred on the 21st and 22nd day of February 2006. That was almost a one month gap. 

Our first meeting with him also coincided with his first visit to the town. All arrangements were made to receive the first citizen of the State and also to explain our predicaments at that moment as refugees in the Army Barracks at  Onitsha. From there we took him round to the affected areas of the crisis such as Bida Road Central and some houses burnt within the area and Oba of Yoruba Palace that was razed to the ground along Sokoto and Ifejika Streets, down to Bridge Head Market by Express where all Northern markets were burnt down. More than 100 lives were lost. Property worth billions were also lost. Businesses were destroyed and burnt completely.  Goat market, cola market which respectively comprised of Northern and Western Nigerians' interest. Beans and rice markets, onions market, vegetable oils all worth millions of Naira were destroyed. Arewa parks which comprise of vehicles/passengers from and to Maiduguri, Bauchi, Gombe, Sokoto, Yola, Kano, Mubi etc and also Osobgo parks were razed. 

To our greatest shock and amazement, the first thing that came out of Peter Obi was "you people should tell your people to stop killing our people in the North!!" Everyone was shocked. We couldn't believe that a whole Chief Executive Governor could be so callous as to utter such  an intolerant statement in public. Needless to say that we all were disappointed. We all dispersed without even a word of condolence from Peter Obi, not to talk of any form of relief materials or compensations of any sort to the biggest community of settlers in the State.

Secondly, when he was about to eject and takeover those markets mentioned earlier which Northerners were in possession of since 1974 when they were relocated from Ochanja Market by the then military government,  the Hausas rejected his moves to takeover without any replacement. He, Peter Obi deployed military men who gunned down seven people to death among the protesters. We petitioned the matter to the Office of the Sultan of Sokoto who sent two Emirs - that of Suleija and the Etsu  Nupe of Bida. It was a wasted effort as nothing concrete was achieved, because Obi refused to provide an alternative land for the markets. Eventually His Eminence, the Sultan of Sokoto and Spirtual leader of Muslims in Nigeria visited the State in the same quest for justice for the Northern and South Western community in Anambra State, but Obi refused to change his recalcitrant position! Simply because we are not Igbos! In Peter Obi's mind, we do not deserve to be owning or occupying any land in Anambra State! In one meeting, he openly stated to us "you people are foreigners here! Therefore you have no right on our land" - a clear case of intolerance, discrimination, hatred, and indeed bigotry to the core. As a result, all the traders relocated to Asaba with their businesses. *How would Peter Obi treat Northerners if he is elected as president of Nigeria?* 

He also said that he hates seeing Hausas at the point of entering Anambra State. 

Thirdly, during the anniversary of creation of Anambra State, towards the end of Peter Obi's administration, we were invited by the organizers of the program. A Igbo lady who resides in the North, while making a point on fostering unity among Nigerians suggested that an exchange program should be established where young people from the State should be sent to Kano in exchange of Kano young vocational trainees. Peter Obi quickly took over the microphone and said there is no comparison between the North and the East, talkless of sharing skills and knowledge! He also  added that such comparison is like asking China to come to Nigeria to learn manufacturing business. He made this assertion in public. i could remember it was the then governor of Rivers State Chief Rotimi Amaechi that chaired the occasion. 

Lastly sometime in 2018, an Igbo Bar owner on Niger Drive, GRA Onitsha, invited a Hausaman to be selling Suya meat in front of the bar just to attract more customers to his own business which is about 300 metres away from Peter Obi's house. To our greatest shock, Peter Obi invited DSS  from Awka to forcibly eject the Hausaman from the place simply because he was a Hausaman from the North. That was his only offence. It took the intervention of the landlord and Arewa leaders in the the State to stop Obi from perfecting this illegal move against a poor Northerner Suya Seller. 

It should also be noted that Peter Obi deported people of Northern extraction back to the North during his tenure as governor of Anambra State.

Now what will Peter Obi tell Northerners if he visits any of the Northern States during campaign? 

Finally, in view of the aforementioned facts and unprovoked actions of Peter Obi against the North and Northerners he is not worthy of a single vote from any patriotic Northern voter.
6/28/22, 3:37 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Them don start the painting session. This artwork no go fine o
6/28/22, 3:39 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: No proof.
6/28/22, 3:39 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Not 1... but tell that to the fence sitters who are looking for any bad report on Pitobi
6/28/22, 3:40 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: It will fail. The usual tactics will fail this time.
6/28/22, 3:40 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: The surest tactic right now is the vote buying technique for the establishment.
6/28/22, 3:41 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: The average northern voter is tired.
6/28/22, 3:41 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: And many moderates and non-muslims in the north will see through that story immediately.
6/28/22, 3:41 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: There is a 'silent majority' of such voters in the north who are waking up.
6/28/22, 3:41 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: A very large unnoticed group.
6/28/22, 3:44 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: The average northerner is tired of Buhari and to a little extent, APC. Unfortunately for Tinubu and Pitobi, they have a northern alternative in Atiku, who they regard as a man that can bring prosperity to them!
6/28/22, 3:47 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Silent majority are still those uneducated non-twitter folks who will always do as their leader says.... don't be fooled by the noisemaking northerners on Twitter bro - they have no political clout!
6/28/22, 5:55 AM - +234 803 669 6995: Leave Nosa
6/28/22, 5:55 AM - +234 803 669 6995: Let him dream
6/28/22, 5:56 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Are those uneducated twitter folks not paying ransom?
6/28/22, 5:56 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Are they able to farm?
6/28/22, 5:56 AM - +234 803 669 6995: Godwin, what have you one to elect Peter? Any advocacy, registration, volunteering, party agent stuff or collating officer?
6/28/22, 5:56 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Are they not paying bandits a tax in Niger
6/28/22, 5:57 AM - +234 803 669 6995: What have you done save for bantering with us, educated folks, hi wont even vote?
6/28/22, 5:58 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Do you know that there are large groups of Christians and minorities who are tired of being told what to do?
6/28/22, 5:59 AM - +234 803 669 6995: Nosa what do you know about the electoral process sef?
6/28/22, 5:59 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Tired of being lumped together with a supposed hegemonic north
6/28/22, 6:00 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Who won't vote? Please who are you referring to?
6/28/22, 6:01 AM - +234 803 669 6995: Or about the different constitutional requirements for office...for example the need to get a 25 percent of the votes in 23rd of 36 states?
6/28/22, 6:01 AM - +234 803 669 6995: Who will drive Peter's campaign? The one governor (Abia) or one senator (Imo) in Labour party?
6/28/22, 6:02 AM - +234 803 669 6995: Nosa, e sure for me say of the 56 of us here, not .more rhan 7 would vote
6/28/22, 6:04 AM - +234 803 669 6995: Have you even considered the untold destruction the 2015 election did to our electoral system especially in the north?
6/28/22, 6:04 AM - +234 803 669 6995: This same North where Perer is an unknown entity?
6/28/22, 6:04 AM - +234 803 669 6995: Let's say for sake of argument, Peter wins.
6/28/22, 6:05 AM - +234 803 669 6995: Who will pass his budget? Who will screen his ministers? Wgi will drive his reforms?
6/28/22, 6:07 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Let us get to that bridge before we cross it.
6/28/22, 6:07 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: If you are not going to vote then no need arguing.
6/28/22, 6:08 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: FYI we are engaging voters outside social media.
6/28/22, 6:08 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Doing our bit here in Warri.
6/28/22, 6:08 AM - +234 803 669 6995: Baba, this is not the West. Even the West doesn't have such Eldorado binary thoughts
6/28/22, 6:08 AM - +234 803 669 6995: Peter will be president one day. That day is not next year. The option for us in next election is to either endorse of reject the APC
6/28/22, 6:08 AM - +234 803 669 6995: Every other argument is infantile, IMO
6/28/22, 6:08 AM - +234 803 669 6995: There is a referendum on the 8 years of the APC in February. And Obi Obi isn't on that ballot
6/28/22, 6:08 AM - +234 803 669 6995: Wake up
6/28/22, 6:09 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Who is US?
6/28/22, 6:09 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Why don't you speak for yourself?
6/28/22, 6:09 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: If you don't believe it is possible the least you can do is step aside for those who think it is.
6/28/22, 6:10 AM - +234 803 669 6995: Same reason Peter wont win. He doesnt plan. He crosses bridges when he gets to them
6/28/22, 6:10 AM - +234 803 669 6995: That is a truly useless leader
6/28/22, 6:10 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: And vote whatever your preferred candidate is.
6/28/22, 6:10 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: I will rather discuss issues than 'possibility' of a candidate winning.
6/28/22, 6:11 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: How do you know that he does not plan?
6/28/22, 6:11 AM - +234 803 669 6995: Another binary thought. It is a democracy for God's sake. Every opinion count
6/28/22, 6:11 AM - +234 803 669 6995: I cant step aside
6/28/22, 6:11 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: lol...doing strong labels again.
6/28/22, 6:11 AM - +234 803 669 6995: And the fact that you are indirectly promoting Tinubu with this your Obi shenanigans?
6/28/22, 6:12 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: That is not democracy then. That is fascism.
6/28/22, 6:12 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Thought police? Lol.
6/28/22, 6:12 AM - +234 803 669 6995: This is fascism
6/28/22, 6:12 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Vote whoever you want and let others alone.
6/28/22, 6:13 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Why continually harangue others as to whether it is possible to elect Obi or not.
6/28/22, 6:13 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Why not vote who you want in peace.
6/28/22, 6:13 AM - +234 803 669 6995: That is how, 8years ago, we christened Buhari a messiah and elected him against simple logic
6/28/22, 6:13 AM - +234 803 669 6995: Now we have christened Obi
6/28/22, 6:13 AM - +234 803 669 6995: Continu
6/28/22, 6:14 AM - +234 803 669 6995: That's th only thing that is encouraging from this Obi debacle. More young people are getting involved. Let's hope it pays off in the duture
6/28/22, 6:14 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: The failure in electing Buhari was because we were also tired of the way things were then. Same logic you are using here that 2023 is a referendum against APC.
6/28/22, 6:15 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: The difference with PO supporters is the way the establishment is running things.
6/28/22, 6:15 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: When we voted APC it was like let there be an alternative that will make the political establishment sit up.
6/28/22, 6:15 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Meanwhile they criss cross from party to party.
6/28/22, 6:15 AM - +234 803 669 6995: So go vote. By all means, please vote. Vote Okanigbiuan if you want
6/28/22, 6:16 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Don't seem to have principles.
6/28/22, 6:16 AM - +234 803 669 6995: But the next president is from Osun or Adamawa
6/28/22, 6:16 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Somersault on issues that we voted them for.
6/28/22, 6:16 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: So many people are disenchanted with them.
6/28/22, 6:16 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Let me ask you a question Joachim.
6/28/22, 6:16 AM - +234 803 669 6995: And remember Nosa, we are not enemies. We are  brothers who want the same thing
6/28/22, 6:16 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: If PDP had put up SOLID opposition in these 8 years will the groundswell in favour of Obi being an issue?
6/28/22, 6:17 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: If PDP as opposition was gauging the heart beat of Nigerians and the youth would the primaries have gone the way it did?
6/28/22, 6:17 AM - +234 803 669 6995: Only that, as much as I detest Atiku,he is a better choice than Tinubu and the APC
6/28/22, 6:17 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: I know that our democracy has not developed to the level of the West but would it not have been better for PDP to provide truly SOLID OPPOSITION to Buhari.
6/28/22, 6:17 AM - +234 803 669 6995: You detest them both too. Only you are dreaming. And I am a realist
6/28/22, 6:18 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: At some point me and you were even more vocal against Buhari than all of the PDP voices put together.
6/28/22, 6:18 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: In fact they were advising me in church and in my family to tone it down.
6/28/22, 6:18 AM - +234 803 669 6995: This is another infantile Obi-esque binary thinking. Why didn't they *give* Obi? Say who him be?
6/28/22, 6:18 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Even if they have structure has Buhari's failures not given them enough Arsenal to be the party of choice in this election.
6/28/22, 6:18 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: You can side step that point. What of the others.
6/28/22, 6:19 AM - +234 803 669 6995: Lily livered guy whi couldn't even see the process through. Is that hiw he wants to govern?
6/28/22, 6:19 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Why did they not put up solid opposition these 7 years.
6/28/22, 6:19 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: What was the process?
6/28/22, 6:20 AM - +234 803 669 6995: Another poor line of thought: PDP ha been a useless opposition. So let the APC, whi has been even more useless in governing, continue
6/28/22, 6:20 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Delegates being bought with USD (allegedly).
6/28/22, 6:20 AM - +234 803 669 6995: The primaries.he chickedned out
6/28/22, 6:20 AM - +234 803 669 6995: Emphasis on allegedly
6/28/22, 6:20 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: If PDP cannot provide leadership in Opposition then you cannot blame the disenchantment with the electorate right now.
6/28/22, 6:21 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: In fact I follow a lot of PDP twitter guyz.
6/28/22, 6:21 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Many of them complained of this severally.
6/28/22, 6:21 AM - +234 803 669 6995: Those disenchanted voters will see real disenchantment  when Tinubu enters
6/28/22, 6:21 AM - +234 803 669 6995: Dont worry
6/28/22, 6:21 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Can you now blame disenchanted voters for looking for an alternative to both parties?
6/28/22, 6:21 AM - +234 803 669 6995: As bad as things are now, when Tinubu enters, we will see
6/28/22, 6:22 AM - +234 803 669 6995: May God not let us miss Buhari one day
6/28/22, 6:22 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: No problem. The beauty of it all is that going forward no matter what happens, the voting bloc that is forming will no longer be taken for granted.
6/28/22, 6:22 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: I don't want Tinubu but I also do not want things to remain the way they have always being done.
6/28/22, 6:22 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Besides discussing strategy and candidates it is better we discuss issues.
6/28/22, 6:22 AM - +234 803 669 6995: Yes. I blame them or allowing sentiments to cloud their judgement. They haveno clue what is coming for them
6/28/22, 6:23 AM - +234 803 669 6995: You are  campaigning for Tinubu. Dont you get?
6/28/22, 6:23 AM - +234 803 669 6995: You are campaigning against the only person and party whi can stop Tinubu In a region that votes the PDP
6/28/22, 6:24 AM - +234 803 669 6995: Baba. There are no issues o discuss here. Elecdon reach
6/28/22, 6:24 AM - +234 803 669 6995: Election don reach
6/28/22, 6:24 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: This line of thought has been overused.

Trump got 81m votes yet he lost. Peter Obi may get 10 million votes due to large voter turnout, but what you underestimate is the mass push for votes from PDP and APC - the already established parties.

Ever wonder why u wear same old clothes you have, even though you have new ones?
6/28/22, 6:36 AM - Obose Eidusi: The thing dey shock me Sha
6/28/22, 6:36 AM - +234 803 669 6995: The only consolation I have is that Peter would soon raise Atiku's hand

6/28/22, 6:52 AM - +234 803 669 6995: As crazy as this sounds, some of my tribesmen are pushing for the APC to continue

6/28/22, 6:53 AM - Brume Ikogho: Unverified nonsense!
6/28/22, 6:54 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: There is no comparison here. Obi and Buhari no get comparison in that area.
6/28/22, 6:54 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Buhari was far worse in hindsight
6/28/22, 7:00 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Hindsight!!!!
6/28/22, 7:00 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Peter don ever manage national crisis before?
6/28/22, 7:01 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Meanwhile, Atiku and Tinubu are the 2 greatest contributors to the emergence of Buhari in 2015.
6/28/22, 7:01 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Recently Atiku was Father of the Day when Buhari's son wedded.
6/28/22, 7:01 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Somehow, Peter Obi that was consistent for 8 years opposing the system.
6/28/22, 7:01 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Did not decamp to APC - PDP - APC as it suited him.
6/28/22, 7:02 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Was consistent on the values he is today still preaching.
6/28/22, 7:02 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: However, you guyz are transferring the annoyance of Buhari's failure to Peter Obi for trying to come out of same establishment that ganged up to produce Buhari.
6/28/22, 7:02 AM - +234 803 669 6995: So you're ready to gamble another 8 years for comparable insight?
6/28/22, 7:02 AM - +234 803 669 6995: The issue here is not even that
6/28/22, 7:03 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: When Tinubu and Atiku were supporting Buhari was it a gamble?
6/28/22, 7:03 AM - +234 803 669 6995: Anyone would do better than Bubu
6/28/22, 7:03 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Did it payoff.
6/28/22, 7:03 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Which includes Peter Obi.
6/28/22, 7:03 AM - +234 803 669 6995: The issue here is that the only person who would do worse than Bubu is who you are campaigning for
6/28/22, 7:04 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: On what grounds are you saying this?
6/28/22, 7:04 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Buhari is clearly not ready to govern.
6/28/22, 7:04 AM - +234 803 669 6995: Yes
6/28/22, 7:04 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: He was not in great health for the first one year.
6/28/22, 7:04 AM - +234 803 669 6995: So because Atiku supprted Bubu we should punish 9ha oth more APC?
6/28/22, 7:04 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: He is clearly aloof and did not bother to educate himself in 30 years.
6/28/22, 7:05 AM - +234 803 669 6995: A terrible as his heath was, he is healthier then Tinubu
6/28/22, 7:05 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: What proof do you have that voting for Atiku is not a continuation of that punishment.
6/28/22, 7:05 AM - +234 803 669 6995: So what's  your point?
6/28/22, 7:06 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: And this is still outstanding.
6/28/22, 7:06 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: The logic that produces this help me understand.
6/28/22, 7:06 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: My point is that your points are pointless.
6/28/22, 7:06 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: You are employing circular reasoning.
6/28/22, 7:06 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Rowing on one side of a boat.
6/28/22, 7:07 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Contradicting yourself steady.
6/28/22, 7:07 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Huh? Baba don move from APGA to PDP to JP now... na Specialist in decamping
6/28/22, 7:07 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Again false comparisons
6/28/22, 7:07 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Which part?
6/28/22, 7:07 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: He left APGA to a better platform which was PDP.
6/28/22, 7:07 AM - Osobase Akhere-Ugbesia: Una go see real politicking. Y the time Tinuku dem return from their trips.. all these bodies when Dey make noise go begin succumb

6/28/22, 7:08 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: He saw that he could not work within such system
6/28/22, 7:08 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: He did not decamp to APC.
6/28/22, 7:08 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: He went to a smaller platform.
6/28/22, 7:08 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Which truly seems to be his crime so far.
6/28/22, 7:08 AM - Osobase Akhere-Ugbesia: He‚Äôs been in PDP without a structure. Ekweremadu and co ensured they shut him out
6/28/22, 7:08 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Coz he no de listen to nobody
6/28/22, 7:09 AM - Osobase Akhere-Ugbesia: Sabi sabi too much. Na theory man
6/28/22, 7:09 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: According to you guyz, this platform will split votes (very possible) and will end up voting Atiku.
6/28/22, 7:09 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Na so so AY show and co him be de attend... no relevance anywhere
6/28/22, 7:09 AM - Osobase Akhere-Ugbesia: By the time killings happen for 18 states simultaneously under e watch, e go turn grey. Make e ask GEJ and PMB Wetin dem go through

6/28/22, 7:11 AM - Obose Eidusi: When campaign starts proper many guys go fall back in line
6/28/22, 7:11 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: The problem with the killings in Nigeria is that they were not nipped in the bud when they started.
6/28/22, 7:11 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: They were seen as 'skirmishes' until they metamorphosed.
6/28/22, 7:11 AM - Osobase Akhere-Ugbesia: Because some are politically motivated
6/28/22, 7:11 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Great.
6/28/22, 7:11 AM - Osobase Akhere-Ugbesia: Some killings na to push agenda
6/28/22, 7:12 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Yes. And in some cases from even the same political parties or regions.
6/28/22, 7:12 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Just to frustrate the system.
6/28/22, 7:12 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Truth is no matter who is voted in these things will still continue.
6/28/22, 7:12 AM - Osobase Akhere-Ugbesia: For example, to ensure state policing works. Kiliings can be sponsored in the rural areas.. next day one governor go begin shout
6/28/22, 7:13 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: These are the issues I was talking about.
6/28/22, 7:13 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: The establishment does not like to discuss issues until you employ violence.
6/28/22, 7:13 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: What is so difficult in discussing this with a mind to making it possible in Nigeria.
6/28/22, 7:13 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: It works in other countries why Nigeria?
6/28/22, 7:14 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Or should we wait till we are a 200 year old democracy.

6/28/22, 7:15 AM - Osobase Akhere-Ugbesia: Ask yourself why it took so long
6/28/22, 7:15 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Until the Oil/Gas industry got to the state it is before they started pushing seriously for it now.
6/28/22, 7:15 AM - Osobase Akhere-Ugbesia: Why can‚Äôt power issue resolved??
6/28/22, 7:15 AM - Osobase Akhere-Ugbesia: Nor, Nigeria is a complex place
6/28/22, 7:15 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Because the system that favours the establishment does not see the serious issues as serious issues.
6/28/22, 7:16 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Egypt got it right after several failed governance issues.
6/28/22, 7:16 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: They experimented with Military then Muslim Brotherhood then Military then democracy.
6/28/22, 7:16 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Now they are serious about fixing their country.

6/28/22, 7:18 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: All those 'complicated' interest groups can he settle or reconcile them?
6/28/22, 7:18 AM - Osobase Akhere-Ugbesia: Benin, ishan, tiv, Ibo, Nupe, Fulani, ijaw, itshekiri, Yoruba, hausa, igala, Ilushi etc.. only one country
6/28/22, 7:18 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Will he be as nepotistic as Buhari?
6/28/22, 7:19 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: A regional government with representatives in as many ethnic districts as possible would have resolved this.
6/28/22, 7:19 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Or at least helped.
6/28/22, 7:19 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Instead PDP played with 2 confabs to no avail.
6/28/22, 7:19 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: No tangible result from 2 confabs.
6/28/22, 7:20 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Until now when the issues are shaking the country to its foundations.

Billionaire‚Äô Femi Otedola in a telephone interview, was asked by the radio presenter, "Sir what can you remember made you a happy man in life?"

Femi said: ‚ÄúI have gone through four stages of happiness in life and finally I understood the meaning of true happiness.

The first stage was to accumulate wealth and means. But at this stage I did not get the happiness I wanted.

Then came the second stage of collecting valuables and items. But I realized that the effect of this thing is also temporary and the lustre of valuable things does not last long.

Then came the third stage of getting big projects. That was when I was holding 95% of diesel supply in Nigeria and Africa. I was also the largest vessel owner in Africa and Asia. But even here I did not get the happiness I had imagined. 

The fourth stage was the time a friend of mine asked me to buy wheelchair for some disabled children. Just about 200 kids. 

At the friend's request, I immediately bought the wheelchairs. But the friend insisted that I go with him and hand over the wheelchairs to the children. I got ready and went with him. 

There I gave these wheel chairs to these children with my own hands. I saw the strange glow of happiness on the faces of these children. I saw them all sitting on the wheelchairs, moving around and having fun. 

It was as if they had arrived at a picnic spot where they are sharing a jackpot wining.

I felt real joy inside me. When I decided to leave one of the kids grabbed my legs. I tried to free my legs gently but the child stared at my face and held my legs tightly.

üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠

I bent down and asked the child: Do you need something else? The answer this child gave me not only made me happy but also changed my attitude to life completely.

This child said: ‚ÄúI want to remember your face so that when I meet you in heaven, I will be able to recognize you and thank you once again.‚Äù

7/1/22, 3:20 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Now Wike is courting Tinubu. At least they will not blame or drag PO supporters for gifting the job to Jagaban if this happens.

7/1/22, 3:27 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Yes. Wike seems annoyed that haven held up the party all this time he seems to have been edged aside. At the end either with APC or PDP they will 'settle' and continue with business as usual.
7/1/22, 3:27 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: They are clearly not in this to serve. It is business.

7/2/22, 3:51 AM - Chinedu Madu: *A Time for Fasting Will Surely Come*
_(Saturday 2nd July 2022. Read Amos 9:11-15, Ps. 85: 9,11-14, Matthew 9:14-17)_ 

_*‚ÄúCan the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? The days will come, when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast.‚Äù (Matthew 9:15)*_

Jesus‚Äô disciples were accused of impiety on the basis of their apparent failure to fast. There are two possible scenarios here; one, the disciples of Jesus were fasting but not showing it. Jesus instructed in the Sermon on the Mount: ‚ÄúWhen you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face, so that your fasting may be seen not by others but by your Father who is in secret.‚Äù (Matthew 6:17-18). 

The second possibility was that they were not fasting. Jesus did not say whether fasting is good or bad. All that Jesus had to say about fasting points to the words of the book of Ecclesiastes: ‚ÄúFor everything, there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven: a time to be born, and a time to die; ‚Ä¶ a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance.‚Äù (Ecclesiastes 3:1-4). 

For Jesus, that wasn‚Äôt the right time to fast. Not that there was anything wrong with fasting but that everything, no matter how good, has its season. New wine is good, old wine is also good. Some prefer old wine, and some will rather take fresh wine. But then, there is a type of bag (season) for old wine and a different bag for new wine. There is a timing for everything. 

When the time is not right, no matter the efforts we put into a particular venture, it will not just work. We even run the risk of losing both wine and skin. In today‚Äôs first reading, Amos prophesied about a time of restoration for the Israelite Nation. This restoration was not to take place until hundreds of years later when God eventually gave the world the gift of His Son Jesus Christ. 

We need to understand that the God we serve is a great planner. Whatever He intends to do is in His special calendar. So when we pray, let us never forget to include the phrase: ‚ÄúYour will be done.‚Äù This implies: ‚Äúaccording to your own timing,‚Äù ‚Äúwhenever and however it suits your plan.‚Äù

There are a lot of things I would have loved to do even in spreading the message of God further but in the last few days I have had to ask myself: ‚Äúam I running faster than God?‚Äù Maybe, the time isn‚Äôt right. Maybe that which looks like something good right now may just be new wine that I am trying to pour into an old wine skin. Today‚Äôs message seems like a personal note to me to cool down and let things just take their course. If the guests cannot fast now, the time will come when the guests will have no choice but to fast.

Let us pray: Heavenly Father, teach me patience and increase my understanding of timing from your angle. Through Christ our Lord. Amen.

*Be Happy. Live Positive. Have Faith. It is well with you. (Saturday of week 13 in Ordinary Time. Bible Study: Amos 9:11-15, Ps. 85: 9,11-14, Matthew 9:14-17)*

Haba...Sir yam... abeg post link here where Biden for ban fracking.... as you claimüò´

Secondly, Keystone pipeline (Phaze1-3) is still very functional o.

It was the KeystoneXL (Phase 4) project Biden halted. The effect of this action on rising petrol prices is non existent. 
The halting of the project did not cause price hike, but It probably would have had a very little effect alleviating the price hike.... But not significantly at all at all.

He said: ‚ÄúOur governance mission will be twin-tracked. Secure Nigeria in every ramification: national security, human security, food security and tackling insecurity created by unemployment.

‚ÄúWe will also seek to unite our nation by pulling our people out of poverty and creating a new sense of nationalism and patriotism. Nigeria shall rise again: and her people will be proud to claim ownership of her patrimony. Doing so is in our collective national interest.‚Äù

7/5/22, 12:07 PM - Brume Ikogho: MISSION GOALS

After several years of impacting lives, driving policies, and supporting the sustainable growth of Nigeria through investments in job creation and education, it is time to amplify the mission together as one people, collectively seeking one future to drive change in this one country we have.  Through several consultations and a holistic review of the present state of Nigeria, we have developed a list of areas that must receive our collective attention in the next 4 years, and this forms the crux of our mission goals.  

To Fix Nigeria and get it working for the greater good.

Unify the country and get its people talking about unity and development. 

Rejig and rejuvenate the comatose economy by diversifying and liberalizing the economy, to generate jobs and create new revenue avenues.

Declare national emergency on Energy, Security, Education, Public Health, and Agriculture, among other critical sectors. 

Ensure food availability and sustainability, adequate National Security and Citizen Welfare. 

To explore mutually beneficial foreign affairs policy, both at Sub-regional, Continental, and international levels and revamp the image of Nigeria as the Giant of Africa. 

To enforce the true principles of the Federal Quota System with emphasis on meritocracy. 

Enrich and enlarge the coast of the Electoral Process: due diligence, fairness, and equity. Plus, the introduction of relevant technology into election management in the country. e.g., Diaspora Voting.

Ensure Women and Youths‚Äô inclusiveness in politics and business.

Upgrade and improve the living standards of security personnel and equipment for the Armed Forces.

Fight corruption judiciously; invest in Edu-innovation and plug into global ecommerce initiatives. 

Ensure prompt payment of pensions to retirees; bequeath a legacy of good governance and real dividends of democracy.

7/5/22, 12:31 PM - Brume Ikogho: Instead of attacking PO, let's talk about why he's not set to win.

-Being intelligent and saying the right things won‚Äôt get people elected nationally in Nigeria, or Awo/Zik would never have lost to Shagari.

- We practice identity politics in Nigeria and vote along ethnic and religious considerations over any other factor.

- We have a very weak Nigerian identity. We put our religion, tribe, gender, party affiliations and other sentiments above being Nigerian.

So just let people support who they want and stop calling them names! 

What will be will be!

2. If anyone is trying to engage me in such a convo, I most times try to confirm they are registered & can possibly vote, if they do decide to 
Else it will just be two adult bounce off opinion about elections they are certainly not going to have meaningful input in.
My time is key!

7/6/22, 1:05 AM - Chinedu Madu: *Empowering the Labourers.*
_(Wednesday 6th July 2022. Read Hosea 10:1-3,7-8,12, Ps. 105:2-7, Matthew 10:1-7)_ 

_*‚ÄúAnd he called to him his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every infirmity.‚Äù (Matthew 10:1)*_  

Jesus asked us to pray that God may send labourers into the harvest. In today‚Äôs Gospel passage, we see Jesus commissioning the twelve giving them authority over unclean spirits, diseases and infirmity. 

As much as we pray for an increase in vocations, we must never forget to pray for an increase in Grace for those who have answered the call already. A labourer without energy (power) is like a very hungry farmer on very fertile land, he has the seeds but cannot dig and plant. He needs to eat in order to produce food for many others. Like the proverbial shoemaker who was so busy mending people‚Äôs shoes, that he forgot to mend his own shoe and suffered from a wound which prevented him from mending other people‚Äôs shoes, priests and religious are ever in need of our prayers.

It is instructive to note that in mentioning the names of the twelve, Matthew deliberately puts Judas Iscariot last and adds the phrase ‚Äúwho betrayed him.‚Äù What kind of labourer am I? A Judas or a Peter? Am I a James or a John so eager for positions? Or am I Andrew who acts only in the background quietly bringing people to Jesus and never taking centre stage? Am I a Thomas whose faith is limited to what his eyes can carry? Am I a Philip or a quiet Thaddeus who likes to do things low-key? Or even, am I a Matthew with a very disturbing past?

The point is that none of these labourers was perfect. Never look down on yourself because the rich harvest of God‚Äôs vineyard neither requires already made Saints nor does it asks only for the talented, the outspoken, the educated, the influential or the technologically driven. So long as you are empowered, you too can labour for God. 

The authority (power) is more important than the person. A traffic controller wearing his vestment on a busy road can stop heavy trucks a hundred times heavier than himself all because the authority was given to him by the state. It doesn‚Äôt matter who is wearing that vest, his authority is what controls cars. So also, a labourer is able to do so much only when he has Divine Power.

Let us pray: Almighty ever-living God, you empowered your disciples, renew your Holy Spirit in me every day that I may not grow weak in your vineyard. Through Christ our Lord. Amen.

*Be Happy. Live Positive. Have Faith. It is well with you. (Wednesday of week 14 in Ordinary Time. Bible Study: Hosea 10:1-3,7-8,12, Ps. 105:2-7, Matthew 10:1-7)*

7/6/22, 3:50 AM - Sylvanus Oseghale: All the choice contracts goes to his family and cronies. You can't erect a single billboard in any choice area of lagos except its for seyi his son. His family owns and dictates everything in lagos. Every project above 1b must pass through his table. Look at the power of touts in lagos, touts dey beat people dey tell u say see police go call dem and nothing go happen, make una dey support bat

7/6/22, 3:53 AM - +234 803 448 4689: You ask if he is healthy and lenzo answer you but you are in doubt so take your doctor to him and test
7/6/22, 3:53 AM - Oshoke Obozuwa: Has issues with everything most especially with knowledge
7/6/22, 3:53 AM - Osho Akagbosu L: Abeg hagi EPP me give sly one omo chewing stick make he take camdan

7/6/22, 3:54 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Bubu wey u vote for nkor? Did he do that?
7/6/22, 3:54 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Why should he not?
7/6/22, 3:54 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Even if he makes it public, una go shout OLUWOLE
7/6/22, 3:54 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: The issue was severally raised then. Yes he did not do that but BAT can show us that he is a man of integrity and talk na do if he surprises us and does it.
7/6/22, 3:54 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Or is it bad if he does it?
7/6/22, 3:55 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: I do not shout Oluwole.
7/6/22, 3:55 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: U whisper?
7/6/22, 3:55 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: If the document exists we will look at it. A reputable doctor can confirm it.

7/6/22, 3:56 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Tell PO to show us his offshore accounts first

7/6/22, 3:56 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Both sides can do more of this.
7/6/22, 3:56 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: More transparency will help us all in this election.
7/6/22, 3:57 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: I will not defend that because it will make me a hypocrite.
7/6/22, 3:57 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Good
7/6/22, 3:57 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: So we can demand transparency from everybody.
7/6/22, 3:57 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Why does he have an offshore account pls
7/6/22, 3:57 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Or our banks are not good enough?
7/6/22, 3:58 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Why use your wealth to help other rich nations?
7/6/22, 3:58 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: What is he hiding?
7/6/22, 3:58 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: There is nothing wrong with investments in another country.
7/6/22, 3:58 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Does he have investments in Nigeria?
7/6/22, 3:58 AM - Osho Akagbosu L: Factos
7/6/22, 3:58 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: So why does he make it seem like he doesn't encourage international investments
7/6/22, 3:59 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: If he has investments in Nigeria then it is great.
7/6/22, 3:59 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: He invested $155m of Anambra money in various forex investments.
7/6/22, 3:59 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: I don't see how he discouraged international investments
7/6/22, 4:00 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: More importantly, why an offshore account that is obscured to prevent folks from establishing ownership and investment patterns?
7/6/22, 4:00 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Why did he do this pls????
7/6/22, 4:00 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Why did he not invest the money in nigeria to help the fledgling economy?
7/6/22, 4:01 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Oh... sorry... he did do some investments in naij, albeit in his family's business
7/6/22, 4:01 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: I'm reminded..
7/6/22, 4:01 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: The investments in Nigeria currency denominations have lost value in two ways...inflation and currency devaluation.
7/6/22, 4:02 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: The investments in the foreign currency have given more value when converted to Naira.
7/6/22, 4:02 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: And how do you know this?
7/6/22, 4:02 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: As at that time the advice was to save and prevent our economy having issues when the rainy day comes
7/6/22, 4:02 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Do you have figures to back this up?
7/6/22, 4:02 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Can't u see there is a fundamental problem here?
7/6/22, 4:03 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Unfortunately the recession came and it turned things in the wrong direction.
7/6/22, 4:03 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: If he had used the money on infrastructural developments in Anambra, a lot of businesses and families would have benefitted from it.
7/6/22, 4:03 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: The savings in question is in dollars.
7/6/22, 4:03 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Not savings - equity in a business that has depreciated. There's a difference.
7/6/22, 4:04 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: The SWF/FAAC money shared from the oil windfall if saved (in dollars) would have helped slow down the recession.
7/6/22, 4:04 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: You confidently stated that the value is higher now in naira terms..  what's this value now?
7/6/22, 4:05 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Can you help me here?
7/6/22, 4:05 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: <Media omitted>

7/6/22, 4:08 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: So you're telling me Peter Obi doesn't have ideas on infrastructural developments... instead he chose to save monies that were badly needed for infrastructural development
7/6/22, 4:09 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: If your predecessor flexes your savings it means it was bad to have saved?
7/6/22, 4:09 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Was OBJ wrong to have gotten debt relieve and then left savings?

7/6/22, 4:16 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: I believe that whatever challenges with the complex nature of our country that he may face he will be able to handle it.
7/6/22, 4:17 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: The issues in Anambra then were complicated albeit at state level but he navigated them.
7/6/22, 4:17 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: At the national level with sincerity and the ability to carry people along he should be able to achieve this.
7/6/22, 4:17 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Let us give him a chance.
7/6/22, 4:18 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: And u kindly helped disparage the list with additional info about Kolas current position on PO. 

Anyway.... I cannot accept a praise singer's biased statement.
7/6/22, 4:18 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: The testimonial is riddled with lies anyway.
7/6/22, 4:18 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: We desperately need to cut cost of governance in the country. If he can do it then it will help free funds to fight security and create jobs.
7/6/22, 4:18 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Please specify which of the statements are lies.
7/6/22, 4:19 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: At 500m/km (which is almost impossible self in naija) u are telling me PO spent 400billion tarring roads in Anambra wey no get oil
7/6/22, 4:19 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: He is not a totalitarian. He cannot control the affairs of states and LGs.

7/6/22, 4:20 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: That is a win.
7/6/22, 4:20 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: If he tries to stiffle the NASS to bend to his demands, the country will be at a political standstill!
7/6/22, 4:20 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: He just needs to show example at the federal level.
7/6/22, 4:20 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Perhaps this will cascade to states.
7/6/22, 4:20 AM - Solomon Aiwerioba: Pls critique this
7/6/22, 4:20 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Fair point.

7/6/22, 6:55 AM - Nosakhare G. OMOIKE: Peter Gregory Obi CON (born 19 July 1961) is a Nigerian businessman and politician who served as the Governor of Anambra State three separate times from 2006 to 2014. In May 2022, he became the Labour Party nominee for President of Nigeria in the 2023 presidential election.

Born in Onitsha in 1961, Obi graduated from the University of Nigeria in 1984. Afterwards he entered business and banking, eventually rising to hold several high-ranking executive positions at banks. By the early 2000s, Obi was the chairman of Fidelity Bank before leaving the position to enter politics. Obi ran for governor in 2003, as a member of the All Progressives Grand Alliance but his main opponent was unlawfully declared victor. After three years of legal battles, Obi was declared winner in 2006 and assumed office that March. He was then impeached that November before the impeachment was overturned and he returned to office in February 2007. Again, Obi was removed when a new election was held in April 2007 but the judiciary intervened again and ruled that he should be allowed to complete a full four-year term. In 2010, he won re-election to a second term. Obi‚Äôs terms were marked by improvements in state finances, education, and healthcare.

After leaving office in 2014, Obi gained new status as an advocate for good governance and national political figure after decamping to the Peoples Democratic Party in 2014. In 2019, he was selected as the vice presidential nominee in the presidential election running alongside Atiku Abubakar, but lost to incumbent president Muhammadu Buhari and vice president Yemi Osinbajo. By 2022, Obi ran for president himself, first in the PDP until defecting to the LP in May 2022.

Early life and education
Peter Obi was born on 19 July 1961 at Onitsha. He attended Christ the King College, Onitsha, where he completed his secondary school education. He was admitted to the University of Nigeria, in 1980, graduated with a B.A. (Hons) in philosophy in 1984.

Peter Obi attended Lagos Business School, where he completed the Chief Executive Program, Harvard Business School, where he completed two major programs, the London School of Economics, Columbia Business School, and the International Institute for Management Development where he received certificates in the Senior Executive Program and the Chief Executive Officer Program. He also attended the Kellogg School of Management of Northwestern University, Said Business School of Oxford University and the Judge Business School of Cambridge University.

Pre-political career
Peter Obi was a businessman before he ventured into politics. According to Peter Obi, he started his life as a trader, being born into trading family before venturing into the corporate world. He held leadership positions in some private establishments. Some of the companies he served includes: Next International Nigeria Ltd, Chairman and Director of Guardian Express Mortgage Bank Ltd, Guardian Express Bank Plc, Future View Securities Ltd, Paymaster Nigeria Ltd, Chams Nigeria Ltd, Data Corp Ltd and Card Centre Ltd. He was the youngest chairman of Fidelity Bank Plc.

Political Career
First Term

Peter Obi contested in the Anambra State Governorship Election as a candidate for the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) party in 2003, but his opponent, Chris Ngige of the People‚Äôs Democratic Party, was declared winner by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).

After nearly three years of litigation, Ngige‚Äôs victory was overturned by the Court of Appeal on 15 March 2006. Obi took office for on 17 March 2006. On 2 November 2006, he was impeached by the state house of assembly after seven months in office and was replaced the next day by Virginia Etiaba, his deputy, making her the first-ever female governor in Nigeria‚Äôs history. Obi successfully challenged his impeachment and was re-instated as the governor on 9 February 2007 by the Court of Appeal sitting in Enugu. Etiaba handed power back to him after the court ruling.

Peter Obi once again left office on 29 May 2007 following the General Elections, in which Andy Uba was declared the winner by the electoral body. Obi returned to the courts once more, this time contending that the four-year tenure he had won in the 2003 elections only started to run when he took office in March 2006. On 14 June 2007 the Supreme Court of Nigeria upheld Obi‚Äôs contention and returned Obi to office. This brought to an abrupt end the tenure of Obi‚Äôs successor, Andy Uba whose 14 April 2007 election the Supreme Court nullified on the grounds that Obi‚Äôs four-year tenure should have remained undisturbed until March 2010.

Second Term

On 7 February 2010, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) declared Peter Obi the winner of the 2010 Anambra State Gubernatorial election, where he defeated Professor Charles Chukwuma Soludo, former governor, CBN. This election victory gave Governor Obi an additional four years as the governor of Anambra State. On 17 March 2014 Peter Obi served out his second term and handed over the governorship to Willie Obiano.

After the 2015 General Election, President Goodluck Jonathan appointed Peter Obi as the chairman of the Nigerian Security and Exchange Commission (SEC).

2019 Presidential Elections

On 12 October 2018, Peter Obi was named as the running mate to Atiku Abubakar, the Peoples Democratic Party‚Äôs Presidential Candidate in the Nigerian 2019 Presidential elections. His party came second.

2023 Presidential Elections

On 24 March 2022, Peter Obi declared his intention to run for the position of President of Nigeria under the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, but later pulled out and announced he would be running under the Labour Party platform instead. According to the Peoples Gazette, Peter Obi wrote to the leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party on 24 May to resign his membership. Obi reportedly complained of massive bribing of delegates and vote buying at party‚Äôs presidential primary, citing the existence of a party clique collaborating against him.

The Nigerian MDGs Office/UNDP Best Governor in the Implementation of the MDGs in Nigeria
Introduction Of Constitutional And Other Major Changes In Nigerian Politics
He was the first gubernatorial candidate in Nigeria to legally challenge to its logical conclusion, his governorship electoral victory that was denied him. He won in the Courts and reclaimed his mandate.
He was the first Governor in Nigeria to legally challenge his wrongful impeachment and was reinstated by the Courts.
He was the first Governor in Nigeria to seek the interpretation of tenures of Governors when INEC allowed elections to take place in Anambra State when his tenure had not expired; the election already concluded was cancelled and he was allowed to complete his tenure.
He was the first Governor to serve a 2nd term in both the new and old Anambra State, that is, almost 40 years after creation of the State.
He was the first Governor, whilst still in Office, to be appointed a Special Adviser to the President.
He was the first serving Governor to be appointed into the Presidential Economic Management Team.
He was among the first Governors to be honoured with a National Award in 2011, while still in office.
Though the only Governor whose political party was in government in only one State, he was elected Vice-Chairman of the Nigeria Governors‚Äô Forum twice.
Though the only non-PDP Governor in the South-East (made up of 5 States), he was elected by the other 4 PDP Governors as their Chairman for 8 years rather than the usual one year.
Fundamental Achievements As Governor Of Anambra State (Partial Listing)
Anambra was the first State to commence Sub-Sovereign Wealth savings, the first of its kind in Sub-Saharan Africa. At a time many other Governors were leaving huge debts, I left the equivalent of $500 million Dollars in investment as well as local and foreign currency, including $156 million in Dollar-denominated bonds.
For the first time in the history of Anambra State, Ambassadors and High Commissioners of notable countries such as United States, Britain, Russia, European Union, South Africa, Belgium, Israel, the Netherlands, Canada, among others, visited the State. Before my tenure, Anambra was practically a pariah state blacklisted by the Diplomatic Corps and international development partners.
Development partners such as UNDP, UNICEF, the World Bank, DFID, the European Union etc., which hitherto were not in Anambra State started working with the State. Anambra was consistently adjudged one of the best states in development partnership and commitment to reforms for good governance.
He was recognised as Best Governor by the Millennium Development Goals Office (OSSAP-MDGs) and the UNDP in the implementation of their programmes in Nigeria.
The Nigerian Debt Management Office (DMO) rated Anambra as the least indebted state in Nigeria. In spite of visible and measurable achievements recorded in various sectors, the State under him did not borrow or raise bonds for her various projects.
The Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria rated Anambra State as the most financially stable state in the country.
The State‚Äôs ground-breaking return of schools to their original owners ‚Äì Voluntary Agencies (Churches) on 1st January 2009, and subsequent partnership with the Agencies in Education, saw the State move from 24th position out of 36 States to Number One in National Examination Council (NECO) and West African Examination Council (WAEC) examinations for three consecutive years. This made the World Bank to commission a study, led by the renowned Prof. Paul Collier of Oxford University, on this revolutionary partnership and phenomenal achievement.
The State also entered into strategic partnership with the Churches in the Health sector. This symbiotic relationship resulted in a tremendous boost to health care because of the services offered by health institutions owned by Voluntary Agencies, while the State restored grants to the agencies and made available to them more than 50 million Dollars in various types of support.
Through partnership with the Church in the Health sector, his Government funded the transformation of -:
Iyienu Hospital, Ogidi.
Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Ihiala.
St Charles Borromeo Hospital, Onitsha.
Holy Rosary Hospital, Waterside, Onitsha.
St. Joseph Hospital, Adazi-Nnukwu.
His Government also built the Joseph Nwilo Heart Centre in St. Joseph, Adazi-Nnukwu, where heart operations are now being performed.
His Government won the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (1 Million dollars) as the best-performing state in immunisation in the South-East. With complementary funding from our Government, they used the money to build 10 Maternal and Child Care Centres across the State, particularly in rural communities, in partnership with the Churches.
The State was the first to procure and distribute more than 30,000 computers to secondary schools, including 22,500 from HP. The Managing Director for Personal Systems Group HP Inc, Mr. FabriceCampoy described the deployment as the biggest of such projects in the Middle-East and Africa.
Anambra State Government provided Microsoft Academies to more than 500 secondary schools, which the Head of Microsoft in Nigeria (Mr. Ken Span) described as the biggest such deployment in Africa so far.
The State provided Internet access to more than 500 secondary schools, which the CEO of Galaxy Backbone (Mr. Gerald Ilukwe) characterized as incomparable to any in the country.
More than 700 buses were provided to secondary schools in the State by our Government.
Boreholes were provided in schools all over the State.
Numerous classrooms were built in all the 177 communities of the State.
As part of the efforts to turn around the economy of the State, a number of companies were attracted to build their facilities in the Anambra State. A case in point is SABMiller, the 2nd largest brewery in the world, which built their first Green Field facility in the State, which is today one of the most successful facilities they operate globally.
A number of other companies followed the SABMiller initiative and were all supported and encouraged under our Government; a good example is INNOSON Motor Manufacturing Company, from which our government bought more than 1,000 vehicles.
Anambra State for the first time started close collaboration with recognized government security agencies (the Police, Army, Navy, Department of State Security, Civil Defence, among others), offering them various types of support including provision of more than 500 security vehicles. The improvement in security was phenomenal, such that the former IG of Police (Abubakar Mohammed) lauded Anambra State for not witnessing any bank robbery in my last three years in office
To further enhance security, Anambra State provided at least one security vehicle to each of all the 177 communities in the State as well as various organizations such as markets and Churches.
His Administration conceived and built, from scratch, the first state-owned Teaching Hospital, Chukwuemeka Odumegwu-Ojukwu teaching Hospital, Awka.
His Government commenced the planned development of the Igbariam Campus of the ChukwuemekaOdumegwu-Ojukwu University, including the fencing, construction of internal roads, electrification, construction of the Faculty of Law, Auditorium, Administrative Block, Faculty of Agriculture, Management Building, among others).
His Government attracted the World Bank support on erosion ‚Äì National Erosion and Watershed Management Project (NEWMAP) ‚Äì to Anambra State.
His Government was the first to do Poverty Mapping in Nigeria, as a guide for the effective implementation of our poverty-alleviation strategies.
His Government, for the first time, undertook the aerial mapping of Awka as well as the production of Structure Plans for Awka Capital Territory, Onitsha and Nnewi.
During his tenure and with his Government‚Äôs support, Anambra State became an oil producing State.
He built the first Secretariat Complex to house State Government Ministries that were hitherto scattered around the State.
His government commenced the development of the ‚ÄòThree Arms Zone‚Äô comprising Government House/Governor‚Äôs Lodge, Legislative Building/Speakers Residence, and Judiciary Building with Chief Judge‚Äôs Residence.
By the end of his tenure in 2014, more than twelve (12) health institutions, including two hospitals, had secured accreditation; when we took off in 2006, no health institution in Anambra State was duly accredited.
Anambra State was the first to undergo national peer review, which scrutinised State Governments for good governance, through the State Peer Review Mechanism (SPRM), an initiative of the Nigerian Governors‚Äô Forum in collaboration with the DFID‚Ä¶

7/6/22, 7:12 AM - Sylvanus Oseghale: BREAKING: All Boko Haram Suspects In Kuje Prison Have Escaped ‚Äì Defence Minister 

The Minister of Defence, Bashir Magashi, has said none of the Boko Haram suspects detained at Kuje prison in Abuja was found after the attack on the facilities on Tuesday night. 

Sources had told Daily Trust that high-profile Boko Haram suspects and bandits escaped during the invasion of the prison on Tuesday night.


Addressing journalists after taking an assessment tour of the facility, the minister said, ‚ÄúThe attack started around 10:30pm. They came in their numbers gained entrance into the prison and they released some of the inmates and which we are now following to see the kind of inmates that they have released. 

‚ÄúVery soon, we will give you the correct figure of the inmates that were taken. Aside that, we are trying to see what we can do to ensure that all escapees are returned back. 

‚ÄúThe prison is accommodating about 994 inmates and over 600 escaped. Many people have been recaptured and brought back to the prison. Maybe by the close of the day, more will have been captured and returned. 

‚ÄúI think everything is under control. The people who came to do this activity, from the records, we believe they belong to a particular group. Most likely, they are Boko Haram members because we have sizeable number of Boko Haram suspects in detention, and presently we cannot locate any of them. 

‚ÄúI think they are about 64 in the prison and none of them now is available they have all escaped.‚Äù

How do you respond to the comment made by Rabiu Kwakwanso that the north will not vote for an Igbo man in 2023? 

Mr. Peter Obi: 
"The comment by the elder brother Kwankwaso is the reason why we have 100 million Nigerians living in poverty, 18 million Nigerian children out of school and about 52% of Nigerians either unemployed or under employed , because rather than vote for competent leaders, we will rather vote for incompetence due to a primitive belief of religion and ethnicity. 

Tell me, today you can‚Äôt travel from abuja to kaduna by road or rail, is it because someone from the south east is in charge ? You can‚Äôt travel to Minna by road, is because someone from the south east is in charge? Yesterday we had an attack by bandits on the presidential convoy, in Katsina, is it because someone from the south east is in charge? Show me where people are prospering in the north or south? What we have consistently done in this country is to hire vehicle drivers to fly airplanes as pilots instead of hiring qualified pilots. 

We have a huge problem and if you don‚Äôt know, this country will soon default on their debt servicing, schools are shut down, insecurity is everywhere, Nigeria is in a coma and when you are in a coma all you want is to survive,  irrespective of where the surgeon who will keep you alive comes from ‚Äú

In addition, he also continued to operate a foreign account as a governor.

To set up what has now become a convoluted business structure, Obi approached Acces International, a secrecy enabler in Monaco, France, to help him incorporate an offshore entity in one of the world‚Äôs most notorious tax havens noted for providing conduits for wealthy and privileged corrupt political elites to hide stolen cash to avoid the attention of tax authorities.

7/7/22, 1:46 PM - Brume Ikogho: His words: ‚ÄúI brought International Breweries into Nigeria and as a Governor of a state, they built a greenfield facility in the state and they came to me and said ‚Äòas our partner, we want you to own 15 per cent of this company‚Äô, and I said to them ‚ÄòNo, right now, I am the Governor of a state. I know the future of this brewery, and I want the state to own 10 per cent and since I‚Äôm no longer involved in the company, they can own five per cent‚Äô. I put in $30million of state money there, it‚Äôs now worth $100million and it‚Äôs still there. No other state in this country has such investment.

‚ÄúPersonally, I have no investment; not even one Naira. Go to Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) today, if you will see Peter Obi as owner of one share; it doesn‚Äôt exist. Next is a family company started by my own parents and as their child, I ran it at a time, and when I became Governor, I had nothing to do with it till today.

‚ÄúI also invested $50million of Anambra State money in the power sector. I invested several billions in banks, including banks where I have shares. I was investing for the future of the state; it doesn‚Äôt matter whether I have shares or not. If I have the opportunity of building the future of the state, wouldn‚Äôt I have done that?

‚ÄúI left office in this country, leaving Anambra State with investment in cash of N75billion. The day I left office, we had $56million, N12billion in Fidelity Bank.; in Diamond Bank, $50million, N12billion; in Access Bank, $50million, N12billion for Anambra State. Show me in the history of this country where anybody has left 10 per cent of that.‚Äù

7/7/22, 4:58 PM - Osa Eweka: Tinubu on being insulted!

"Some people get easily angry whenever they see me being insulted. I think that is childish. I'm a politician and it is my right to be insulted. It is my right to be called names, it is my right to get bad wishes from whoever I outrun in the polity. Politics, sometimes, is a bully game, don't get distracted, keep your eyes on the ball. It is a game of number but equally important, a game of common sense with sole aim of improving people's lives with right policies. Mohammed Ali was a great boxer, he punched you once, he ran away, he made you angry so much that you lose your focus and balance, then he would hit you hard..Those who must beat him must never be angry or lose focus while fighting, keep your strategy to yourself. Win some and lose some, that's politics but you must strive to win all but you can never win all.....As for insults and abuse, I have received uncountable insults since I joined politics. You can see where I am today politically. I'm a product of insults, left right and centre, that's my food and medicine. I'm not complaining, keep it up."

- Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu
